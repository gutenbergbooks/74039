  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In your ordinary use of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, you give
your attention to the <i>one</i> article that will answer the <i>one</i> question
you have in your mind. The aim of this Guide is to enable you to
use the Britannica for an altogether different purpose, namely, for
systematic study or occasional reading on any subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>The volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica contain forty-four
million words—as much matter as 440 books of the ordinary octavo size.
And the subjects treated—in other words, the whole sum of human knowledge—may
be divided into 289 separate classes, each one completely
covering the field of some one art, science, industry or other department
of knowledge. By the mere use of scissors and paste the alphabetical
arrangement of the articles could be done away with, and the
Britannica could be reshaped into 289 different books containing, on
the average, about half as much again as an ordinary octavo volume.
It would misrepresent the Britannica to say that you would then have
289 <i>text-books</i>, because there is an essential difference in tone and purpose.
A text-book is really a book intended to be used under the
direction and with the assistance of a teacher, who explains it and
comments upon it. The Britannica, on the other hand, owes the position
it has enjoyed since the first edition appeared in 1768 to the fact
that it has succeeded, as no other book has succeeded, in teaching
without the interposition of a teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not, of course, claimed that the idea of reading certain groups
of Britannica articles in the order in which they will combine themselves
into complete books is a novel invention. Thousands of men
owe the greater part of their educational equipment to a previous
edition of the Britannica. And not only did they lay out their own
courses of reading without the aid of such a Guide as this, but the
material at their disposal was by no means so complete as is the 11th
Edition. Every edition of the Britannica before this one, and every
other book of comparable size previously published, appeared volume
by volume. In the case of the last complete edition before the present,
no less than 14 years elapsed between the publication of the first
volume and the last. It is obvious that when editors have to deal with
one volume at a time, and are unable to deal with the work as a
whole, there cannot be that exact fitting of the edges of one article
to the edges of another which is so conspicuously a merit of the 11th
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>Edition. All the articles in this edition were completed before a
single volume was printed, and the work stood, at one stage of its
preparation, in precisely the form which, as has already been said,
might be given to it by merely rearranging the articles according to
their subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this Guide, the principal articles dealing with the subject of
each chapter are named in the order in which you may most profitably
study them, and the summaries of the larger articles afford such
a preliminary survey as may assist you in making your choice among
the courses. Besides, where it seems necessary, there is added to the
chapter a fairly complete list of all articles in the Britannica on the
subject, so that the reader may make his study exhaustive.</p>

<p class='c006'>A brief review of the six parts into which the Guide is divided will
show the general features of its plan, of which a more detailed analysis
is given in the Table of Contents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part 1 contains 30 chapters, each designed for readers engaged in,
or preparing for, some specific occupation. To the beginner, who still
has everything to learn, the advantages derived from such a course of
study may well be so great as to make the difference between success
and failure in life, and to those who have already overcome the first
difficulties, to whom the only question is how marked a success awaits
them, the Britannica can render invaluable service of another kind.
No amount of technical training and of actual experience will lead a
man of sound judgment to believe that he alone knows everything
that all his competitors put together know; or that his knowledge and
theirs is all that ever will be known. The 1500 contributors in 21
different countries who wrote the articles in the Britannica include the
men who have made the latest advances in every department of knowledge,
and who can forecast most authoritatively the results to be expected
from the new methods which are now being experimentally
applied in every field of activity. The experienced merchant, manufacturer,
or engineer, or the man who is already firmly established in
any other profession or business, will naturally find in some of the
articles facts and figures which are not new to him, but he can profit
by the opportunity to review, confirm, reconsider and “brush up” his
previous knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part 2 contains 30 chapters, each devoted to a course of systematic
study designed to supplement, or to take the place of, some part of
the usual school and college curriculum. The educational articles in
the Britannica are the work of 704 professors in 146 universities and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span>colleges in 21 different countries. No institution of learning in the
world has a faculty so numerous, so authoritative, or so highly specialized.
Nor has any system of home study ever been devised by which
the student is brought into contact with teachers so trustworthy and
so stimulating. The fascination of first-hand knowledge and the
pleasure of studying pages intended not for reluctant drudges submitting
themselves to a routine, but for students eager to make rapid
progress, are factors in the educational value of the Britannica that
cannot be overestimated, and the elasticity with which any selected
course of study can be enlarged and varied is in full accordance with
the modern theories of higher education.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part 3 is devoted to the interests of children. The first of its chapters
describes Britannica articles of the utmost practical value to
parents, dealing with the care of children’s health, with their mental
and bodily training, and with the intelligent direction of their pastimes.
The second chapter indicates varied readings in the Britannica
for children themselves, showing how their work at school can be made
more interesting and profitable to them by entertaining reading on
subjects allied to those included in their studies. The third chapter
in this Part gives a number of specific questions such as children are
prone to ask, as well as questions which may be put to them in order
to guide their natural inquisitiveness to good purpose. The references
to pages in the Britannica show where these questions are clearly and
instructively answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part 4 suggests readings on questions of the day which relate to
American citizenship and to current politics. A study of the articles
indicated in this section of the Guide will aid the reader not only to
form sound opinions for himself, but also to exercise in private or
public life the influence for good which arises from a clear view of the
arguments on both sides of controverted questions. It is no exaggeration
to say that the Britannica is the only existing work in which such
subjects as tariffs, trusts, immigration, labour and the relation between
legislative and judiciary powers are treated without partisan bias and
with adequate fulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part 5, especially for women, deals with their legal and political
status in various parts of the world, their achievements in scholarship,
art and science, as well as with home-making, domestic science and
kindred subjects. The important part which women, both among the
contributors and on the editorial staff of the Britannica, took in the
preparation of the work sufficiently indicates that the editor-in-chief
made ample provision for the subjects peculiarly within their sphere.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>Part 6 is an analysis of the many departments of the Britannica
which relate to recreation and vacations, travel at home and abroad,
photography, motoring, out-door and indoor games and other forms of
relaxation and of exercise. The extent to which the work can be used
in planning motoring tours, and the superiority, in such a connection,
of its articles to the scant information found in ordinary guide books,
are shown in the extracts, included in this Part 6, relating to a trip
from New York through the Berkshire Hills to the White Mountains.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be seen from this brief survey of the field covered by the
Guide that provision has been made for every purpose which can dictate
the choice of a course of reading. But as you proceed to examine
its contents for yourself, you should remember that the lists it gives
name only a fraction of the articles in the Britannica, and that for a
fuller summary of the work as a whole you should turn to the Table
on pp. 881–947 of Vol. 29.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, the form in which this Guide is printed may call for a
word of justification. It is inevitable that chapters, of an analytical
character, bespattered with references to the numbers of volumes and
of pages, and terminating with lists of the titles of articles, should bear
a certain air of formality. There is no danger that the possessor of the
Britannica, familiar with the fascination of its pages and the beauty
of the illustrations which enhance their charm would permit his impression
of the work itself to be affected by the bleak appearance of
the Guide. But he may feel that because a list has a forbidding aspect
the pleasure he has derived from browsing at will in the Britannica
would give place to a sense of constraint if he rigidly pursued a course
of reading. It may easily be shown that such a fear would be groundless,
for the Britannica articles are all the better reading when one
carries forward the interest which one of them has excited to others
of related attraction. But to anyone who is firmly determined that
he shall not be persuaded to read systematically, the Guide will none
the less be useful, for he may flit from one chapter to another, selecting
here and there an article merely because the account which is given
of it pleases him. Or, better yet, he may find, in one portion only of
a selected course, a series of only three or four articles which will, in
combination, make the best of occasional reading.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Every farmer in the United
States knows that farming is
to-day an industry which calls for
study of the world’s agricultural products,
processes, and markets as well as
for scientific knowledge of soils, crops,
and animals. Fifty years ago the farmer
sold for consumption in his immediate
neighborhood the small surplus of his
crops that was not needed for his own
household and live stock. To-day he
competes, in all the world’s great markets,
with all the world’s farmers, and
is the chief among American exporters.
The Russian wheat fields and the Argentine
cattle ranches are really nearer to
him than a farm in the next township was
to his grandfather. He lives better, does
more for his children and pays higher
wages than do farmers in other parts of
the world, and yet he can successfully
compete with them, because, as the
article on Agriculture in the Encyclopædia
Britannica says, in speaking of the
United States, “<span class='under'>there is no other considerable
country where as much mental
activity and alertness has been applied
to the cultivation of the soil as to trade
and manufactures</span>.” American farmers
“have been the same kind of men, out
of precisely the same houses, generally
with the same training, as those who
filled the learned professions or who
were engaged in manufacturing or commercial
pursuits”; and their competitors
abroad have been, for the most part,
ignorant peasants. The course of reading
indicated here is designed for wide-awake
farmers who intend to be large
farmers—by whom the latest information
and the broadest outlook are recognized
as essential to their calling. <i>If
you think the articles named here cover a
great deal of ground, remember that the
Massachusetts Agricultural College provides
no less than sixty-four distinct courses
of instruction, and that the subjects included
in all the sixty-four are treated in the Britannica.</i></p>

<h4 class='c016'>GETTING “GROUNDWORK” KNOWLEDGE</h4>

<p class='c017'>You may think, as you look at the
titles of articles mentioned in these
pages, that there are some which you
need not read because you have already
read bulletins of the United States Department
of Agriculture or of your State
Experiment Station. These official publications
are most valuable, but naturally,
they do not attempt to cover the
whole range of agricultural subjects as
the Britannica does—they are not intended
for that purpose. Their arrangement
and the way in which they are
issued shows that they are designed to
meet only certain special needs, not to
give a general view of all the branches of
farming. One subject may for example
be discussed in three different bulletins,
published in three different years, and the
first may be out of print before the third
appears. In the Britannica you get information
that forms the very foundation of
a thorough knowledge of farming and
that also extends over the widest field. Of
course it would be absurd to say that
merely reading these articles will make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>any man a successful farmer as to say
that a medical student who works hard
at his books will always develop the
tact and the sound judgment that a
doctor needs. But unless the medical
student has studied those text books he
will never make a successful doctor; and
similarly the information in the Britannica
will give the farmer new advantages,
no matter how much practical experience
and special training he has had.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Scope of the Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>There are in the Encyclopædia Britannica
1,186 articles dealing with animal
and vegetable life; and among the 11,341
geographical articles
a great many give
important information
about the production,
distribution and consumption of
farm products. Those upon continents,
countries, states and provinces describe
the local crops and any local methods of
farming that are of special interest.
<i>There are some 600 articles on individual
plants</i>, of which a list will be found on
pp. 889 and 890 of Vol. 29 (the index
volume). If any one of these thousands
of articles were not in the Britannica,
it would not be quite so valuable as
it is to you, for you may, any day, want
to find out about any plant that grows,
or about farming in any part of the world.
A professor in an agricultural college
would of course be glad to study the
whole series. But in this Course of
Reading only the articles which are
of most immediate use to all practical
farmers are mentioned, and the contents
of each of these is described, so that you
can omit any article that goes into details
which you think you do not want. If
you do skip any of them, it will, however,
be a good plan to mark their titles
in this list, for you may like to come back
to them later when you realize how practical
and understandable all the Britannica
articles are—even those with dullsounding
names.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course you will begin by reading
the article <span class='sc'>Agriculture</span> (Vol. 1, p. 338),
by Dr. Fream and Roland Truslove,
which is the key to the whole subject.
And remember that this chapter of the
Readers’ Guide <i>mentions only those subjects
that are treated more fully in other
parts of the Britannica than in that article</i>,
so that the chapter does not attempt to
tell the whole story.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Soil and Subsoil</div>

<p class='c007'>The first thing a farmer has to deal
with is the ground from which his crops
are to come. The whole surface of the
earth was originally hard
rock. The article on
<span class='sc'>Petrology</span>, the science
of rocks (Vol. 21, p.
323), by J. S. Flett, and the second
part (Vol. 11, p. 659) of the article
<span class='sc'>Geology</span>, by Sir Archibald Geikie, deal
with the “weathering” of rock, which
has in great part broken it down
into the small particles of stone that,
mixed with decayed roots and plants,
form the soil or subsoil. It may seem
that it is going very far back into the
origin of things for a farmer to read about
the sources from which soil comes, but
the nature of the mineral substances in
it has a great deal to do with its power
to nourish plants, and you cannot know
too much about the material on which
your principal work is done. The article
which should next be read, <span class='sc'>Soil</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 345), continues the story of these
particles of rock and shows how sand
and clay must be combined with decaying
vegetable or animal matter in order
to make the best soil. This mixture is
in turn “weathered” by air, heat, frost,
and moisture; and not only the size of
the grains in which it lies, but also their
shape—which makes them pack more
or less tightly—affect the pores, or
spaces between the grains, through which
the roots of the plants must push their
way, and through which air and water
must reach these roots. The article
<span class='sc'>Earthworm</span> (Vol. 8, p. 825) describes
the useful part that worms play in
stirring the mixture, while the natural
and artificial fertilizers, which supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>whatever ingredients the soil lacks, are
discussed in the article <span class='sc'>Manures and
Manuring</span> (Vol. 17, p. 610). An important
part of this article deals with the
best methods of keeping farm yard manure
in such a way that it does not lose its
value before it is spread over the fields,
and with the use, in this connection, of
the liquid-manure tank. The microbes
in the soil render the farmer an enormous
service by changing crude nitrogen,
which plants cannot digest, into the
forms in which it is indispensable to
them, and this process is described in the
article <span class='sc'>Bacteriology</span> (Vol. 3, p. 164),
by Professor Marshall Ward, Professor
Blackman, and Professor Muir.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sunlight and Shade, Heat and Cold, Water Enough—and Not too Much</div>

<p class='c007'>The action of light, the supply of
which is just as necessary in causing
growth as the warmth the sun gives, and
the action of water and of heat and
cold, are explained in
the section “Physiology” (Vol. 21, p.
745) of the article on <span class='sc'>Plants</span>. The
proper method of working each farm,
with a view to using these four in
the right proportions, is influenced by
the latitude in which it lies, its height
above sea level, the protection that
mountains give it, the slope at which
the fields face the sun or turn away
from it, the rain-fall, the relative dampness
or dryness of the air when it is
not raining, and the moisture of the
soil. Every one of these subjects is
vital to the farmer, and the Britannica
brings to its readers the latest information
regarding them in articles written
by the leaders of progress. You will
find the latest scientific guidance, in the
most practical shape, in the articles
<span class='sc'>Climate</span> (Vol. 6, p. 509), by Professor
R. de C. Ward, of Harvard, <span class='sc'>Meteorology</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 264), by Professor
Cleveland Abbe, of the United States
Weather Bureau, and <span class='sc'>Acclimatization</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 114). The distribution of
heat in the soil is described in the article
<span class='sc'>Conduction of Heat</span> (Vol. 6, p. 893),
where the diagram showing variations of
temperature at different depths in the
soil should be carefully studied.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Drainage and Irrigation</div>

<p class='c007'>The brackish water that troubles
farmers near tidal creeks, the alkali
water that often occurs West of the
Mississippi, and the stagnant water that
never does the farm any good, are all as
bad in their way as the river-floods or
the merely sodden soil in which nothing
will grow but coarse grass that is always
unsafe pasturage. Drains and embankments
need very careful planning, and
sound information will be found in the
articles <span class='sc'>Drainage of Land</span> (Vol. 8,
p. 471), <span class='sc'>Reclamation of Land</span> (Vol.
22, p. 954), and <span class='sc'>River Engineering</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 374), the latter by Professor
L. F. Vernon H. Harcourt, the
leading authority on such subjects the
world over.</p>

<p class='c007'>The saving of water and the method
of bringing it to the farm and distributing
it over the fields are authoritatively
discussed in the articles <span class='sc'>Irrigation</span>
(Vol. 14, p. 841), <span class='sc'>Water Supply</span> (Vol.
28, p. 387), by G. F. Deacon, <span class='sc'>Windmill</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 710), <span class='sc'>Pump</span> (Vol. 22, p. 645),
and in the section headed “Utility of
Forests” (Vol. 10, p. 646) of the article
<span class='sc'>Forests and Forestry</span>, by Gifford
Pinchot, formerly U. S. Chief Forester.
The other parts of this article, dealing
with the timber industry, are of
course important to farmers whose land
includes any lumber. <span class='sc'>Water Rights</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 385) explains the laws which
regulate the taking of water from streams
and lakes, and the article <span class='sc'>Lake</span> (Vol.
16, p. 86) is also of interest in connection
with irrigation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Farm Buildings and Fences</div>

<p class='c007'>When the farmer, who has to be
everything by turns, has been an engineer
long enough to get the water off his
farm or on his farm—and perhaps he
has to do both in different parts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>same farm—he must next take on the
builder’s job. He will be reminded of a
good many precautions and economies
that are often overlooked,
and may
find, too, some hints
that are quite new
to him, in the excellent series of articles,
all by experts in the building trade: <span class='sc'>Farm
Buildings</span> (Vol. 10, p. 180), <span class='sc'>Building</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 762), <span class='sc'>Foundations</span> (Vol. 10,
p. 738), <span class='sc'>Brickwork</span> (Vol. 4, p. 521),
<span class='sc'>Stone</span> (Vol. 25, p. 958), <span class='sc'>Masonry</span> (Vol.
17, p. 841), <span class='sc'>Timber</span> (Vol. 26, p. 978),
<span class='sc'>Carpentry</span> (Vol. 5, p. 386), and <span class='sc'>Roofs</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 697). The use of concrete
for buildings, tanks, irrigation works,
etc., has proved so successful, and is so
rapidly increasing, that you will be
especially interested by the article <span class='sc'>Concrete</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 835). <span class='sc'>Barbed Wire</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 384), in which the meshed
field fencing, of late increasing in favor,
is also dealt with, is another practical
article.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Agricultural Machines</div>

<p class='c007'>Advertisers no doubt supply you with
more literature about farm machinery
than you find time to read, but that
makes it all the more
essential to get sound
information that has
no trade bias. The
Britannica goes into the principles of construction
and helps you to see the good
and bad points in the new models you
are constantly offered. You can learn a
great deal from the articles <span class='sc'>Plough</span> (Vol.
21, p. 850), <span class='sc'>Harrow</span> (Vol. 13, p. 27),
<span class='sc'>Cultivator</span> (Vol. 7, p. 618), <span class='sc'>Hoe</span> (Vol.
13, p. 559), and the sections on machines
in the articles <span class='sc'>Hay</span> (Vol. 13, p. 106),
<span class='sc'>Reaping</span> (Vol. 22, p. 944), <span class='sc'>Sowing</span> (Vol.
25, p. 523) and <span class='sc'>Thrashing</span> (Vol. 26,
p. 887). <span class='sc'>Oil Engine</span> (Vol. 20, p. 35),
<span class='sc'>Water Motors</span> (Vol. 28, p. 382) and
<span class='sc'>Traction</span> (Vol. 27, p. 118) are also of
importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Farm horses and the other live-stock
required in general farming fall under
Chapter II of this Guide.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Farm Finance</div>

<p class='c007'>You cannot read the articles already
mentioned, and consider all that has to
be done in merely getting a farm ready
to be worked, without
realizing how grossly
unfair it is that the
American farmer should
be hampered, as he is, by the want
of proper banking facilities when he
is making a start. And after he has
bought and prepared his land and
equipped and stocked his farm he needs,
each year, money to finance his crops.
For any loan used in the purchase of land
and in permanent improvements such as
buildings, drainage, irrigation, a mortgage
is the natural security; but the
short-term farm mortgages—five years
at most—customary in the United States,
do not give the farmer as much time as
he needs for repayment, no matter how
successful he may be. The average
farm offers quite as good a certainty of
continued earning power as does the
average railroad, and farm mortgages
should be—in fairness—regarded not as
opportunities for short loans, but as
sound standing investments, just as
suitable as railroad bonds for conservative
investors. The farmer’s position is
even worse when he needs a short loan
that he will be able to repay as soon as
his crops have been sold, for he is then
expected either to give a mortgage as
security or to pay exorbitant interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the prosperous conditions
of farming in the United States,
the country as a whole produces only
half as much grain for every acre of farm
land as is produced in Europe, and the
only reason is that most of our farmers
lack the capital needed in order to get
the fullest yield from their land. In the
chief European countries, the system of
banking facilities for farmers, described
in the article <span class='sc'>Co-operation</span> (Vol. 7,
p. 86), by Aneurin Williams, shows
what can be done, and sooner or later
will be done, in the United States. This
article fully describes the admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Raiffeisen banks in Germany, which are
based upon the idea that a society of
farmers (restricted to the neighborhood,
so that each member’s honesty and capability
are known to the other members)
make themselves jointly responsible for
loans to the members. A promissory
note is the only security required. The
French, Italian, Austrian, and other
systems are also discussed in the Britannica,
but the German plan is that which
offers the best example to America.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Plants and Crops</div>

<p class='c007'>This course of reading has now covered
the conditions and the material required
for farming, and it is time to get down
to something that
<i>grows</i>. In the old
books everything
about the life of a
plant was treated as a part of the science
of botany, and if you remember the
botany you were taught at school, you
remember a string of long names and
very little else. There is of course an
article on botany in the Britannica, but
it deals chiefly with the history of
botanical science, and the life of the plant
is treated under another heading, and
in a novel, interesting, and practical way.
The article <span class='sc'>Plants</span> (Vol. 21, p. 728) is
indeed one of the most important and
unusual in the Encyclopædia, giving the
results of recent investigation which you
could not find in any other book. It is
written by eight contributors, all men
who have done a great deal of original
work. The section on classes of plants
is by Dr. Rendle, that on the anatomy of
plants by A. G. Tansley, that on the
healthy life of plants by Professor J.
Reynolds Green, that on their diseases
by Professor H. Marshall Ward, that on
the relation between plants and their surroundings
by Dr. C. E. Moss, that on
plant cells by Harold Wager, that on the
forms and organs of plants by Professor
S. H. Vines, and that on the distribution
of plants in various parts of the world by
Sir. W. Thiselton-Dyer. Special accounts
of the chief parts of the plant are
given in the articles <span class='sc'>Leaf</span> (Vol. 16, p.
322), <span class='sc'>Stem</span> (Vol. 25, p. 875), and <span class='sc'>Root</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 712). The success of artificial
fertilization or impregnation is explained
(Vol. 13, p. 744) in the article
<span class='sc'>Horticulture</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apart from the diseases described in
the section, already mentioned, of the
article <span class='sc'>Plants</span>, the greatest danger to
which crops are exposed is that of insect
pests, and the special article <span class='sc'>Economic
Entomology</span>, dealing with them (Vol. 8,
p. 896), gives a full account of each of
the remedies that have proved useful.
The cotton boll weevil is the subject of
a most interesting section of the article
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> (Vol. 7, p. 261). Separate
articles are devoted to individual pests,
such as <span class='sc'>Locust</span> (Vol. 16, p. 857), and—turning
to a larger enemy—<span class='sc'>Rabbit</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 767). There is no bird that
troubles the farmer, or helps him by
killing insects, upon which there is not
an article, for more than 200 distinct
bird articles are listed under the heading
“Birds” on p. 891 of Vol. 29 (the index
volume), in addition to the information
in the article <span class='sc'>Bird</span> (Vol. 3, p. 959), and
the article on families of birds (Vol. 20,
p. 299).</p>

<p class='c007'>The crops of all climates are treated in
general in the article <span class='sc'>Agriculture</span>, and
in particular under their individual
names, all of which are so familiar, and
indeed so fully listed on p. 889 of Vol. 29
(the index volume), that they need not
be repeated here. Naturally you will
include in this course of reading the
crops with which you are personally
concerned, and in any case you ought to
read <span class='sc'>Grass and Grassland</span> (Vol. 12,
p. 367), and <span class='sc'>Grasses</span> (Vol. 12, p. 369).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wheat</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Wheat</span> (Vol. 28, p. 576)
deals with one of the chief products of
“the greatest cereal producing region of
the world.” It begins
the story of a wheat
crop with the burning of
the old straw of the previous year,
then takes up ploughing, harrowing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>seeding, thrashing, labor in connection
with all these operations, and transportation
and marketing. At this
point, the article <span class='sc'>Flour and Flour
Manufacture</span> (Vol. 10, p. 548), by
G. F. Zimmer, takes up the later
history of wheat. It may surprise you
to learn from the Britannica that wheat
first found its way to America through a
few grains being accidentally mixed with
some rice. <span class='sc'>Barley</span> (Vol. 3, p. 405) is an
interesting article on the grain that is the
oldest cereal food of the human race, and
that is also remarkable for its power to
grow over a greater range of latitude
than any other grain. <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> (Vol. 7,
p. 256), by Professor Chapman, is an
article of which the vast importance
may be judged by the following table
taken from page 261:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_008.jpg' alt='PRODUCTS FROM A TON OF COTTON SEED' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Every one of the other cereal and
general crops produced in any part of the
world is treated in the Britannica with
the same fullness of information and with
the same practical detail which characterizes
these articles on wheat, barley and
cotton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the principal articles on the
routine of farming such as sowing, reaping,
and the like, have already been mentioned
in connection with agricultural
machinery. The articles on individual
countries contain sections on the crops
of each of them, and you will find
<span class='sc'>Canada</span> (Vol. 5, p. 152), and <span class='sc'>Germany</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 810), of special interest.
The special features of tropical farming
are described in the articles on tropical
crops.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fruit and Flower Growing</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Fruit and Flower Farming</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 260) covers fruit culture
in general, and, in the section of it which
deals with the United
States (Vol. 11, p.
268), the American
fruit crops. This
section describes the wonderful development
of the fruit industry since
cold transportation and cold storage
enabled consumers in every part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>country, and in Europe as well, to purchase
fruit grown in whatever state most
advantageously produces any one variety.
You should select, from the
twenty separate articles on individual
fruits, not only those on the varieties
which you are already growing, but
those on any others that are possible in
the part of the country where your land
lies. The section on fruit in the article
on <span class='sc'>Horticulture</span> (Vol. 13, p. 775) is
devoted to growing on a smaller scale,
in gardens. It contains (Vol. 13, p.
780) a practical calendar to show each
month’s work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Flower culture is the subject of special
sections in both the articles above named
and there is a descriptive list (Vol. 13,
p. 766) of more than three hundred hardy
annuals, biennials, and perennials, full
of practical information. The calendar
already mentioned indicates the dates
for indoor and out-door operations. From
the many articles on individual flower
plants listed at the end of Part 3 of this
chapter you can make your own choice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Poultry and Bees</div>

<p class='c007'>Poultry and their rearing are dealt
with in the articles <span class='sc'>Poultry and Poultry
Farming</span> (Vol. 22, p. 213), <span class='sc'>Fowl</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 760),
<span class='sc'>Turkey</span> (Vol. 27,
p. 467), <span class='sc'>Guinea
Fowl</span> (Vol. 12, p.
697), <span class='sc'>Duck</span> (Vol. 8, p. 630), <span class='sc'>Goose</span> (Vol.
12, p. 241), and <span class='sc'>Incubation</span> and <span class='sc'>Incubators</span>
(Vol. 14, p. 359). Bee-keeping and
the honey industry are treated in the articles
<span class='sc'>Bee</span> (Vol. 3, p. 625) and <span class='sc'>Honey</span> (Vol.
13, p. 653). Truck farming is treated in
the section dealing with vegetables
(Vol. 13, p. 776), of the article <span class='sc'>Horticulture</span>.
Apart from the law as to
water rights already mentioned the legal
doctrine most particularly affecting farmers
is that of <span class='sc'>Emblements</span> (Vol. 9,
p. 308). <span class='sc'>Grain Trade</span> (Vol. 12, p. 322),
and <span class='sc'>Granaries</span> (Vol. 12, p. 336), the
latter describing the latest type of grain
elevators, are articles of great interest to
farmers who specialize in cereal crops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new system of purchase of grain
by the government, which is working
admirably in Western Canada, protects
the farmer against the speculators who
buy standing crops for less than a fair
price, and it is to be hoped that some
similar plan may be adopted in the
United States.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Economics</span> (Vol. 8, p. 899), by Professor
Hewins, <span class='sc'>Co-operation</span> (Vol. 7,
p. 82), and <span class='sc'>Tariff</span> (Vol. 26, p. 422),
deal with topics related to the marketing
of all agricultural products. The articles
on learned societies have an extensive
section (Vol. 25, p. 317) on the agricultural
societies of all countries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The History of Farming</div>

<p class='c007'>Agricultural history is, naturally, based
upon the history of vegetable life, and
the fossil plants described in the article
<span class='sc'>Palæobotany</span> (Vol.
20, p. 524), long as
their appearance preceded
that of man,
greatly affected the nature of the earth’s
crust which he was to occupy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earliest of all known writings, the
Code of Khammurabi, described in the
article on Babylonian Law, shows (Vol. 3,
p. 117) that agriculture was the subject
of careful legislation under the oldest
government of which a contemporary
record has survived; and the provisions
as to the working of land on the “metayer”
system, under which the landowner
received from the landholder a
share of the crops, and as to irrigation,
are most explicit and practical. Ancient
Egyptian implements of agriculture are
fully described (Vol. 9, p. 69) in the
article <span class='sc'>Egypt</span>, and pictures of them
appear on page 72 of the same volume.
If the ancient history of farming interests
you, it is only necessary for you to
turn to the heading “Agriculture,” in
the Index (Vol. 29), where you will find
references to a number of other articles
on the early civilizations.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these articles, as from the historical
section of the guiding article
<span class='sc'>Agriculture</span>, and the passages relating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>to agriculture in many of the 6,292 articles
on the histories of races and countries,
the reader may learn that agriculture
has been the key to all history. The
earliest migrations of the human race, as
definitely as the comparatively recent
development of America, Australasia and
the interior of Africa, were based upon
an agricultural impetus. And his reading
upon other subjects in the Encyclopædia
Britannica will often remind him
that the wool and cotton and linen and
leather that we wear, the carpets and
blankets and sheets in our houses, all
originated in farming of one kind or another;
while every food that nourishes us,
save fish and game, is directly an agricultural
product. All the bustle of the
great cities, all the wheels that turn in
the mills, all the intricate mechanism of
industry and commerce, all the world’s
work and thought and happiness, depend
upon the mysterious and inimitable
processes by which the brown soil yields
green growth. For all the progress
science has made, we are no nearer to
replacing these processes by any short
cut of chemistry than were the first farmers
whose husbandry is recorded in history.
If all the little roots ceased for
one year to do their work in the dark, the
human race would hopelessly starve to
death.</p>

<p class='c007'>The alphabetical list of articles at the
end of Chapter III of this Guide will
make it easy for you to add to this course
of reading, choosing for yourself the line
that will be most attractive to you. In
making your choice, do not forget that
plant-life is a subject you cannot study
too closely. No matter what crop you
make your specialty, you have to <i>educate</i>
the plants that produce it to do their
work, just as carefully as a teacher
trains children. Another fact to keep in
mind is that just as a doctor is dealing
with organs in the human body which he
cannot see, so you are particularly concerned
with the roots down in the soil, and
the more you know about the way they
eat and drink, the better for your farm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The names of many of the writers of
these articles are given in the table of the
1,500 Contributors to the Britannica,
beginning at page 949 of Vol. 29 (the
index volume); a glance will show you
what authoritative positions they occupy
and how thoroughly they command your
confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<i>See list of articles on subjects connected
with farming, at the end of Chapter III of
this Guide.</i>]</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c014'>FOR STOCK-RAISERS</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Stock-raising in the United
States was, until quite recent
years, under the evil influence of
the careless methods which had been
handed down from the old days of the
range-cattle industry. Chicago men still
tell the story of the Chicago banker,
afterwards Secretary of the Treasury,
who declared, in reply to a request for a
loan on the security of range-cattle, that
he “would as soon lend money on a
shoal of mackerel in the Atlantic Ocean.”
The vague possession and the vague
methods of breeding and marketing
which suggested this comparison did not
form the habits of close observation and
incessant care which became necessary
when land and food began to cost money.
The lesson has been learned, and the
present conditions of the industry are
infinitely better for the country at large.
It has been proved that fattening as well
as breeding can be successfully undertaken
in almost every part of the United
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>States. Even in the North West, the
tendency to-day is to turn from exclusive
grain growing to a combination of cropping
and feeding. Cattle, and also work
horses of the right type, for which the
demand is always greater than the supply,
are yielding fair profits on many of
the New England farms which had been
neglected for years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Staying on the Land</div>

<p class='c007'>One of the most encouraging features
of the present situation is that the
broader distribution of the live-stock
industry encourages
farm-bred boys to
remain at home. It has long been a
popular belief that the attraction of the
cities lies largely in the facilities for
amusement which they offer; but the best
class of young men who have left the
farms have done so because they did not
believe that plowing and sowing and
reaping gave enough scope for their intelligence
and their initiative. When
stock-raising is combined with tillage,
there is not only a greater interest in
farm life and a greater chance to make
general knowledge effective, but there
are also better opportunities for a young
man to make a small venture of his own
while he is still a farm hand. It is certainly
true that stock-raising needs the
young man who is determined to know
something about everything and all there
is to know about one thing. To him the
articles in the Britannica which are indicated
in this chapter should be of the
greatest value, for they cover a broad
range, and they are written by specialists
of the highest authority. They do not
profess to teach what can only be learnt
in the course of practical experience, but
they will make each day’s work more
interesting and more effective.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cattle</div>

<p class='c007'>You cannot do better than to begin
your reading with the article (Vol. 4,
p. 337) on the family of animals to
which cattle belong, a family so varied
that it includes so small a creature as
the hare, and so large a one as the
rhinoceros. The article
<span class='sc'>Cattle</span> (Vol. 5, p. 359),
by Professor Wallace and
Dr. Fream, begins by reminding you
that the idea of cattle owning has always
been so closely associated with the idea
of wealth that the two words “capital”
and “cattle” have the same root, and
that our word “pecuniary” is taken
from the Latin term for cattle. This
article, illustrated with photographs of
the best specimens of bulls and cows of
different breeds, deals with Shorthorns,
Herefords, Devons, Holsteins, Dutch
Belteds, Sussexes, Longhorns, Aberdeen-Angus,
Red Polleds, Galloways, Highlands,
Kerry’s, Dexters, Jerseys and
Guernseys, and has a section on the
rearing of calves. <span class='sc'>Ox</span> (Vol. 20, p. 398)
is chiefly about the origin of domestic
cattle. <span class='sc'>Agriculture</span> (Vol. 1, p. 388)
contains information of a more general
kind as to practical stock-raising. The
best methods of mating are described
fully in <span class='sc'>Breeds</span> and <span class='sc'>Breeding</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 487), <span class='sc'>Variation</span> and <span class='sc'>Selection</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 906), and <span class='sc'>Heredity</span> (Vol.
13, p. 350), by Dr. Chalmers Mitchell.
<span class='sc'>Mendelism</span> (Vol. 18, p. 115) will tell you
all about the theory which is nowadays
the great subject of discussion among experts
in breeding. <span class='sc'>Embryology</span> (Vol.
9, p. 314), by Dr. Hans Driesch, and
<span class='sc'>Reproduction</span> (Vol. 23, p. 116), by Professor
Vines, contain the results of the
latest investigations, and the article <span class='sc'>Sex</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 747) describes the recent experiments
undertaken with the hope that
breeders may at some future time be
enabled to vary at will the proportion of
males and females. <span class='sc'>Telegony</span> (Vol.
26, p. 509) gives you the evidence for and
against the belief that offspring are influenced
by a previous mate of the dam.
<span class='sc'>Food Preservation</span> (Vol. 10, p. 612)
and <span class='sc'>Refrigerating</span> (Vol. 23, p. 30)
cover the cold shipping and cold storage
of beef. <span class='sc'>Leather</span> (Vol. 16, p. 330), by
Dr. J. G. Parker, one of the foremost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>technical experts on this subject, follows
hides through the market to their final
distribution and industrial uses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horses and Mules</div>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the harm that trolley
cars and automobiles and mechanically
propelled agricultural machines have
done to important
branches of the horse
business, and notwithstanding the
competition which American exporters
find in Europe from the Argentine
ranches, there is still an active market
for farm horses and for stock suited to
trucking and light delivery work in cities.
You no doubt find, in whatever part of
the United States your interests lie, that
you need to watch the market very
closely, and that you must always be
ready to change your plans at short
notice. But it is to the quick-witted
man who is always prepared to vary his
methods that the Britannica offers the
greatest practical services. The article
on the horse family in general (Vol. 9,
p. 720) is very interesting, but you will
give more time to the elaborate article
<span class='sc'>Horse</span> (Vol. 13, p. 712), by Richard
Lyddeker, E. D. Brickwood, Sir William
Flower, and Professor Wallace. The illustrations
are unusually valuable, for
instead of following the usual custom of
making all the photographs the same
size, the Editors of the Britannica showed
good sense and originality by making
each one to scale. The breeds are separately
described, and the sections on
feeding and breaking are full of useful
hints. The history of the thoroughbred
strain is carefully traced, the pedigree of
one famous type being shown in a table
naming more than one hundred ancestors.
The article <span class='sc'>Horse-Racing</span> (Vol.
13, p. 726), by Alfred Watson, shows how
the sport has influenced breeding, and
the description of American trotting goes
back to the day when “Boston Blue,”
in 1818, trotted a mile in three minutes,
“a feat deemed impossible” at that
period! The English race meetings, in
which American owners and jockeys now
play so conspicuous a part, are described
in special sections, as well as the training
at Newmarket. <span class='sc'>Riding</span> (Vol. 23, p. 317),
and <span class='sc'>Driving</span> (Vol. 8, p. 585), are by
practical experts, and <span class='sc'>Traction</span> (Vol.
27, p. 118) contains an interesting table
analyzing the draft power of the horse.
The section on Arab horses in the article
<span class='sc'>Arabia</span> (Vol. 2, p. 261) should be read,
for it adds to the information, in the
articles already named, on the breed that
has influenced every variety of horse.
<span class='sc'>Mule</span> (Vol. 18, p. 959) will tell you
about the varieties not only in the
United States and Mexico, but also in
France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Asia
Minor, Syria, Egypt, Algeria and North
China. The section on Hybrids (Vol.
13, p. 713) of the article <span class='sc'>Horse</span> deals
with all the attempts that have been
made to get a perfect type of mule by
introducing various strains of blood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sheep and the Wool Market</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sheep</span> (Vol. 24, p. 817) contains
separate descriptions of the 28 best
breeds, discussing their values both for
wool and for the
meat trade. Breeding,
feeding, dipping
and lambing are fully
treated. Sheepdogs and other breeds
useful to the stock-raiser fall under the
article <span class='sc'>Dog</span> (Vol. 8, p. 374). <span class='sc'>Wool</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 805), by Professor Aldred
Barker, is an article in which you will at
once be impressed by the splendid thoroughness
that is characteristic of the
Britannica. It goes to the very foundation
of the subject by giving you microscopic
photographs, on a scale of 320 to
1, of each of the six great varieties of
wool, and explaining the structure of the
fibres. The article <span class='sc'>Fibres</span> (Vol. 10, p.
309) will enable you to compare another
microscopic photograph of wool fibre
with similar pictures of silk, flax, cotton,
jute, and other textile materials. The
article wool deals next with wool-yolk
and wool-fat, and then goes on to
show why greasy wool is better than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>wool washed before shearing. Wool
classing and sorting are next described,
and then scouring. From this point the
treatment of wool hardly comes within
the jurisdiction of the sheep-man, although
he cannot know too much about
the qualities of the yarns obtained from
different kinds of wool. It is interesting
to note in this article that the first fulling
mill in America was built at Rowley,
Mass., in 1643, only thirty-four years
after the first sheep was brought to
America, and only twenty-three years
after the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth
Rock.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pigs and Pork</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Swine</span> (Vol. 26, p. 236)
deals with the swine family in general,
and the article <span class='sc'>Pig</span> (Vol. 21, p. 594), containing
a fine full-page
plate, gives a
detailed account of
the breeds most profitable
on the farm, including the Poland-China,
the Berkshire, the Duroc, and
the Chester White. Eleven breeds in
all are particularized. The breeding and
fattening of hogs, although it is now
successfully followed as a distinct branch
of the live-stock industry, must always
remain in great part a mere branch of
general farming; for the pig’s power of
thriving on many kinds of food, enables
the farmer to utilize produce that cannot
advantageously be shipped, and to
keep his pigs following his cattle over
the fields. Much information will be
found all through the article <span class='sc'>Agriculture</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 388). <span class='sc'>Trichinosis</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 266) deals with a disease that
has sometimes seriously affected the pork
market, and been made the excuse, too,
for some very harsh restrictions on
American exportation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Diseases and Parasites of Live-stock</div>

<p class='c007'>You will find in the Britannica (Vol.
28, p. 6) a very full and clear account of
the diseases of all domestic animals, by
Dr. Fleming and Professor McQueen,
with special sections on the maladies of
the horse, of cattle, of sheep, and of
pigs, and on the parasites that infest
them. <span class='sc'>Tuberculosis</span>
(Vol. 27, p.
354) calls for special
study, for it is a
“disease of civilization”
almost unknown among wild
animals in their natural state and
among the uncivilized races of mankind.
The connection between the disease
in cattle and its spread among
human beings is fully explained in this
article. <span class='sc'>Pleuro Pneumonia</span> (Vol. 21,
p. 838) deals with the lung disease from
which cattle are the only sufferers,
<span class='sc'>Rinderpest</span> (Vol. 23, p. 348), with the
infectious fever which affects both cattle
and sheep, and <span class='sc'>Anthrax</span> (Vol. 2, p. 106),
with the terribly infectious carbuncles
communicated from cattle and sheep to
man by the microbes carried in wool and
hides. <span class='sc'>Glanders</span> (Vol. 12, p. 76) describes
the form in which this disease of
horses and mules afflicts human beings,
the symptoms and course of which, in
the animals themselves, fall under the
subject of horse diseases (Vol. 28, p. 8).
The microbe by which this disease is
carried is shown in the plate facing one
of the pages (Vol. 20, p. 770) of the
article <span class='sc'>Parasitic Diseases</span>. <span class='sc'>Foot and
Mouth Disease</span> (Vol. 10, p. 617)
afflicts cattle, sheep, and pigs, and
occasionally human beings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the articles on continents and
countries which contain special information
on stock-raising, you should not miss
the interesting general review of the
European live-stock industry in the
article <span class='sc'>Europe</span> (Vol. 9, p. 914), the
section on live-stock in <span class='sc'>Canada</span> (Vol. 5,
p. 153), that in <span class='sc'>Argentina</span> (Vol. 2, p.
465), in <span class='sc'>Australia</span> (Vol. 2, p. 950),
and in <span class='sc'>New Zealand</span> (Vol. 19, p. 627)
The history of stock-raising is fully
treated at the beginning of the article
<span class='sc'>Agriculture</span> (Vol. 1, p. 388).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How to “Even Up”</div>

<p class='c007'>When you have read the articles mentioned
in the three parts of this chapter
on Farming, do not turn away with the
idea that you have got from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Britannica all that
it can give you to
help you in your
business. Remember
that you have to judge men, as
well as live-stock, in order to succeed,
and that general knowledge is of the
greatest use in doing that. The one
sure sign of the kind of man you cannot
rely upon is that he talks confidently
about subjects of which he really knows
little, and the more you yourself know,
the more readily you can detect the pretentious
people who might make you
think too well of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you turn over the pages of this
guide, and ask yourself, as you glance at
the chapters, in what departments of
general knowledge you are weakest, you
will see what courses of reading will do
most to make you an “evened up” man,
without any weak threads in your intellectual
texture. And, whatever you
read, do not forget that the Britannica
is a book of reference as well as for reading:
that you are debasing your mind
every time you leave unanswered any
question that comes up in the course of
the day’s work or talk, or while you are
reading your newspaper. A vigorous
mind wants an answer whenever it becomes
conscious of a question or of a
doubt, and if you fail to feed it with the
information it asks for, it loses health.
Now that you have the Britannica, the
food is in the store-room, do not leave
it there!</p>

<p class='c007'>[<i>See list of articles on subjects connected

    <div>SEE ALSO CHAPTER I, FOR FARMERS, AND CHAPTER II, FOR STOCK-RAISERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The admirable set of rules for
dairy farmers issued by the
United States Department of
Agriculture begins by telling you to
“read current literature and keep
posted on new ideas.” And you can
easily see that the information on
dairy-farming and the many subjects
connected with it, supplied by the Britannica,
must cover a much broader field of
new ideas than can be included in any
periodical or dairying manual. The
branches of science in which the greatest
advance has been made since the beginning
of the present century happen to be
those that have most to do with dairying;
and the industry itself has been
completely revolutionized since the days
when cities got their milk from ramshackle
cow-sheds in their suburbs, and
when butter-making was regarded as
one of the “chores” to be done at odd
times.</p>

<p class='c007'>The key article in the Britannica,
<span class='sc'>Dairy and Dairy Farming</span> (Vol. 7,
p. 737), deals with the best milking
breeds, the installation, equipment, and
management of a dairy farm, the values
of various kinds of pasturage and fodder;
with the milk trade, with butter-making
and cheese-making, with condensed milk,
skim milk, and milk powder and with
the organization and operation of creameries,
cheeseries, and dairy factories in
general. Such subjects as soil, grass,
hay and other fodder crops fall under
Part I of this chapter, and the articles
dealing with the breeding and rearing
of dairy cattle are mentioned in Part
II, “For Stock-Raisers.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dairy-Herd Diseases</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Cattle diseases in general are also
covered by the course of reading suggested
in Part II; but the dairy farmer
has a special interest in contagious
mammitis, milk
fever, contagious
abortion, and cowpox, all of which are
described (Vol. 28, p. 10) in the article
on <span class='sc'>Veterinary Science</span>. You cannot
study too carefully the article on <span class='sc'>Tuberculosis</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 354), for this terrible
infection is not only a standing danger
to your herd, but also affects the transportation
and marketing of milk. Dr.
Hennessy, who wrote the article, is an
expert of the first rank and, like most
other great authorities, is not inclined to
encourage the popular exaggeration of
the dangers for which newspaper “sensations”
are responsible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Milk and the Milk Market</div>

<p class='c007'>You get to the very foundation of the
supply of milk in Professor Parson’s and
Dr. Edmund Owen’s article <span class='sc'>Mammary
Gland</span> (Vol. 17, p.
528), in which the
comparative anatomy
of the milk yielding
organ is fully treated. The article
<span class='sc'>Milk</span> (Vol. 18, p. 451) discusses the
chemistry of many kinds of milk and the
diseases carried by milk, and deals with
the gravest problems of the industry: the
difficulty of sterilizing milk, so that
tuberculosis and typhoid cannot be
carried by it, and the difficulty of sterilizing
cream, so that butter may be quite
safe, without making the milk less nutritious
and the butter less delicate in
flavor. The article <span class='sc'>Bacteriology</span> (Vol.
3, p. 156), by Professor H. Marshall
Ward and Professor Blackman, goes to
the root of this whole question of infection.
Milk is, on the other hand,
used to convey into the human system
the “friendly microbes,” and the use of
soured milk and cheese for this purpose
is explained in the articles <span class='sc'>Therapeutics</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 800) and <span class='sc'>Longevity</span> (Vol.
16, p. 977), which deal with Metchnikoff’s
system of treatment. <span class='sc'>Pepsin</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 130) describes the process
by which milk is rendered more digestible,
and <span class='sc'>Infancy</span> (Vol. 14, p. 513)
deals with the preparation of milk to be
sold for the use of young children. There
is so general a demand for prepared milk
which is from every point of view wholesome
that you will find it worth while to
read, in this connection, <span class='sc'>Food</span> (Vol. 10,
p. 611), <span class='sc'>Nutrition</span> (Vol. 19, p. 920) and
<span class='sc'>Dietetics</span> (Vol. 8, p. 214).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Products and Marketing</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Butter</span> (Vol. 4, p. 889,) and <span class='sc'>Cheese</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 22) are brief articles which
you should not overlook, although they
refer you to the key
and article on dairying
for details; and <span class='sc'>Oils</span>
contains (Vol. 20,
p. 47) an interesting analytical table in
which butter is compared with other
animal fats. <span class='sc'>Food Preservation</span> (Vol.
10, p. 612) deals with the cold storage of
butter, cheese, condensed milk and milk
powder; and <span class='sc'>Refrigerating</span> (Vol. 23,
p. 30) with the processes and machinery
employed. <span class='sc'>Koumiss</span> (Vol. 15, p. 920)
describes the milk-wine or milk-brandy
prepared by fermenting mare’s milk, and
the similar product “kerif” made from
cow’s milk. Although the special developments
of dairying in various parts
of the world are discussed in the article
<span class='sc'>Dairy and Dairy-Farming</span>, the articles
on individual countries also contain
information of value. The section on
dairying (Vol. 5, p. 154) in the article
<span class='sc'>Canada</span>, and the account of co-operative
dairying (Vol. 7, p. 87) in <span class='sc'>Denmark</span>
should not be overlooked.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reading these articles in Britannica,
and thinking of the present conditions of
this great business, you will be reminded
that dairying is an industry of peculiar
importance to the whole people of the
United States, not only because of the
money made out of it, and not only
because it gives hundreds of thousands of
men employment on the land instead of
in crowded cities, but also because it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>promises to develop the co-operative
action which harmonizes with the best
ideals of democracy. The co-operative
plants which are beginning to be established
by dairy farmers are the only
institutions our modern civilization has
created in which you find the neighborly
spirit that the first American
settlers showed in the days when they
joined to defend themselves against the
Indians. At political meetings, in machine
shops and cotton mills and shoe
factories, you hear unhappy talk about
the relations of capital and labor, about
strikes and trusts, about the man on
top and the man underneath. But where
the farmer’s wagons clatter up to the
separator platform, there is combination
in the best sense of the word. The
Britannica article on co-operation says
that the word “in its widest usage,
<i>means the creed that life may best be
ordered not by the competition of individuals,
where each seeks the interest of
himself and his family, but by mutual
help, by each individual consciously
striving for the good of the social body
of which he forms part, and the social
body in return caring for each individual;
‘each for all, and all for each’ is its
accepted motto. Thus it proposes to
replace among rational and moral things
the struggle for existence by voluntary
combination for life.</i>”</p>

</div>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Technical Education for Manufacturer and Merchant</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The article on <span class='sc'>Technical Education</span>
in the new (Eleventh) Edition
of the Encyclopædia Britannica
(Vol. 26, p.
487), written by
Philip Magnus, one
of the greatest educational
authorities
in the world, says
that:</p>

<p class='c020'>“The widespread appreciation of
the advantages of the higher education
among all classes of the American
people, and the general recognition
among manufacturers, engineers
and employers of labour, of the value
to them in their own work, of the
services of college-trained men, has
largely helped to increase the number
of students in attendance at the universities
and technical institutions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A still broader truth is that the men
who have learned to think clearly, by
whatever study or <i>reading</i> they may
have developed that power, possess the
greatest of all advantages. As the
Britannica article on <span class='sc'>Education</span> indicates,
the true value of education (not
simply school education, but all education)
lies as much in the influence which
intelligently directed study exerts upon
the mind as in the immediate usefulness
of the information acquired, and the
articles in the Britannica not only supply
the most recent and authoritative information,
but are so logically arranged,
one dove-tailing into another, that they
give the reader precisely that <i>orderly</i>
view of knowledge which is the foundation
of all mental training.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since all of the series of chapters
which immediately follow and which are
intended for merchants and manufacturers,
deal with commerce and manufactures,
it will be for the reader’s convenience
to begin by dealing with those
two subjects in general. But certain
branches of industrial and manufacturing
knowledge are dealt with in special
chapters. The articles on banking and
finance are described fully in this
Guide in the chapter <i>For Bankers and
Financiers</i>, those on insurance in the
chapter <i>For Insurance Men</i>, and those
on law in the chapter <i>For Lawyers</i>.
Three of the legal articles should, however,
be mentioned here, as they are
on especially important subjects: <span class='sc'>Sale
of Goods</span> (Vol. 24, p. 63), <span class='sc'>Company</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 795), which deals with the
laws in various countries regulating
corporations, and <span class='sc'>Employers’ Liability</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 356), on this topic so important
in modern industrial law and in
the relations between capital and labour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Practical Economics for Practical Men</div>

<p class='c007'>The broad questions of commercial
and industrial policy are discussed in
<span class='sc'>Economics</span> (Vol. 8, p. 899), by Prof.
Hewins; <span class='sc'>Commerce</span> (Vol. 6, p. 766);
<span class='sc'>Trusts</span> (Vol. 27, p.
334); <span class='sc'>Monopoly</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 733),
and <span class='sc'>Trade Organization</span>
(Vol. 27, p.
335), which describes commercial associations
in the United States, the work
of the consular service, and the organizations
in Germany, France, Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Britain and other countries. <span class='sc'>Book-keeping</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 225), with its
up-to-date account of modern accounting
methods, card ledgers and loose
leaf systems; <span class='sc'>Advertisement</span> (Vol.
1, p. 235), and <span class='sc'>Mercantile Agencies</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 148) may be named as
specimens of the many practical articles
on business methods which need not
all be enumerated here.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Imports and Exports</div>

<p class='c007'>Much of what you read and hear
about the tariff systems of the United
States and various other countries and
about their influence
upon trade is so
vague and confusing
that you will be
delighted with the group of clear,
common-sense articles in the Britannica.
<span class='sc'>Tariff</span> (Vol. 26, p. 422) is by one of the
most famous American economists, Prof.
Taussig of Harvard, and is a very full
and fair discussion of the points in controversy.
<span class='sc'>Protection</span> (Vol. 22, p. 464)
is by Prof. James of the University of
Illinois, and <span class='sc'>Free Trade</span> (Vol. 11, p. 89)
by William Cunningham. You should
read with care <span class='sc'>Customs Duties</span> (Vol.
7, p. 669); <span class='sc'>Free Ports</span> (Vol. 11, p. 88),
and <span class='sc'>Bounty</span> (Vol. 4, p. 324). <span class='sc'>Balance
of Trade</span> (Vol. 3, p. 235) and <span class='sc'>Taxation</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 458) are both by Sir Robert
Giffen. <span class='sc'>Exchange</span> (Vol. 10, p. 50), by
E. M. Harvey, a partner in one of the
largest firms of bullion brokers in the
world, deals with the movement of
gold. <span class='sc'>Commercial Treaties</span> (Vol.
6, p. 771) is by Sir C. M. Kennedy.
Freights are discussed in <span class='sc'>Affreightment</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 302) by Sir Joseph
Walton. <span class='sc'>Lien</span> (Vol. 16, p. 594), with its
section on “Stoppage in transitu,” is by
F. W. Raikes; <span class='sc'>Salvage</span> (Vol. 24, p. 97),
by T. G. Carver, and <span class='sc'>Blockade</span> (Vol.
4, p. 72), by Sir Thomas Barclay, the
great international lawyer in Paris.
Marine insurance, indemnity, Lloyds,
and other insurance subjects fall
under the chapter of this Guide
<i>For Insurance Men</i> to which you
should refer. Cargo-carrying and merchant
shipping are further covered by
<span class='sc'>Shipping</span> (Vol. 24, p. 983). This article
is by Douglas Owen, honorary secretary
and treasurer of the Society of National
Research, and author of <i>Ports and
Docks</i>; it contains information about
the great freight carrying lines of the
world that can be found in no other
book. Railroad freighting is covered
by the article <span class='sc'>Railways</span> (Vol. 22, p.
819), in which there is a special
section (p. 854b) on the new models of
American freight cars.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Manufacturing and Consuming Nations</div>

<p class='c007'>In the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>, which
contains more matter than a whole book
of ordinary size and more information
than a dozen ordinary
books, the sections
(Vol. 27, p.
639) on manufactures
and on foreign
and domestic commerce, are by F. S.
Philbrick, Ph.D. <i>The internal commerce
of the United States, as this article
states, is in itself greater than the total
international commerce of the world</i>, and
is so far from exhausting the country’s
power of production and consumption,
that even when coastwise traffic is disregarded,
New York is the most active
port in the world. A section (Vol.
9, p. 916) of the article <span class='sc'>Europe</span> deals
with European commerce in general.
The articles on the great manufacturing
towns of Europe contain much information
as to industries. Great
Britain’s industries are dealt with
in the article <span class='sc'>United Kingdom</span> (Vol.
27, p. 691). The industries of England
alone are separately treated in a section
(Vol. 9, p. 426) of the article <span class='sc'>England</span>.
Germany’s industries are the subject of
sections (Vol. 11, p. 811) of the article
<span class='sc'>Germany</span>; and it is interesting to note
that although Germany has outranked
France in cotton manufactures since
Mülhausen, Colmar and other important
milling centres of Alsace became
German, France has retorted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>overtaking and passing Germany in the
production of linen. The sections (Vol.
10, p. 785) on foreign commerce in the
article <span class='sc'>France</span> show her position as in
the main a self-supporting country,
though only a fourth of the cargoes
loaded and discharged in French
ports are carried under the French
flag. It would be a waste of space
to enumerate here the articles on
Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and other
countries, which you will consult in
relation to those of their exports
in which you are especially interested;
but you should not overlook the article
on Japan. The Britannica has done
commerce a great service in giving to the
world at last a good account of this
extraordinary country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body of the article <span class='sc'>Japan</span> (Vol.
15, p. 156) is by Capt. Brinkley, long
editor of the Japan <i>Mail</i>, whose
opportunities of seeing Japanese life
from the inside have been greater
than those of any other foreign observer.
Baron Dairoku Kikuchi, President
of the Imperial University of
Kyoto, a statesman of great experience
and authority, contributes to the article
a section (Vol. 15, p. 273) dealing with
Japan’s international position. His remarks
upon the commercial morality of
the Japanese are so ingenuous and so
candid that an extract from them cannot
be omitted:</p>

<p class='c020'>Now when foreign trade was first opened,
it was naturally not firms with long-established
credit and methods that first ventured upon the
new field of business—some few that did failed
owing to their want of experience—it was rather
enterprising and adventurous spirits with little
capital or credit who eagerly flocked to the
newly opened ports to try their fortune. It was
not to be expected that all or most of those
should be very scrupulous in their dealings with
the foreigners; the majority of those adventurers
failed, while a few of the abler men, generally
those who believed in and practised honesty as
the best policy, succeeded and came to occupy an
honourable position as business men.... Commerce
and trade are now regarded as highly
honourable professions, merchants and business
men occupy the highest social positions, several
of them having been lately raised to the peerage,
and are as honourable a set of men as can be met
anywhere. It is, however, to be regretted that
in introducing Western business methods, it has
not been quite possible to exclude some of their
evils, such as promotion of swindling companies,
tampering with members of legislature, and so
forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The account (Vol. 15, p. 201) by Capt.
Brinkley of the curious system of creating
branches of Japanese business
houses is another part of this article
which should not be overlooked.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mill Labour</div>

<p class='c007'>The proportion of labour cost to the
total cost of production is in most
industries so great that you cannot study
too carefully every
aspect of the labour
question. The chief
articles are <span class='sc'>Labour
Legislation</span> (Vol. 16, p. 7), jointly written
by the late Dr. Carroll D. Wright,
the great American authority on the
subject, and Miss A. M. Anderson,
Principal Lady Inspector of Factories to
the British government; <span class='sc'>Trades Union</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 140); <span class='sc'>Strikes and Lockouts</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 1024); <span class='sc'>Wages</span> (Vol. 28, p.
229), by Prof. J. S. Nicholson; <span class='sc'>Profit
Sharing</span> (Vol. 22, p. 423), by Aneurin
Williams and <span class='sc'>Apprenticeship</span> (Vol. 2,
p. 228), by J. S. Ballin. The article
<span class='sc'>Employers’ Liability</span> (Vol. 9, p. 356),
has already been mentioned.</p>

</div>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Practical Men Among the Contributors</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The Course of Reading outlined
in this chapter will help anyone
who has to do with the making
or with the buying and selling of
textiles, in three ways, at least, each
of the greatest importance to him—and
possibly in many more. Taking up
these three:—In the first place, it will
teach him many facts about manufacturing
and merchandizing in general,
and about dry goods in particular,
that he could learn nowhere else,
because the scope of the Britannica
is broader than that of any other
book—or, for that matter, than the
scope of any collegiate course can
well be. In the second place, the
number of distinguished men who
have devoted their exclusive attention
to the subjects upon which they write,
and have given to the Britannica the
results of their research
and of their
experience as practical
experts—in many
cases, indeed, as successful
business men—is far greater than
the number of men who form the faculty
of any university in the world. The
fifteen hundred contributors in fact include
no less than 704 connected with the
staffs of 151 different universities, technological
and commercial institutes and
colleges in twenty countries. The reader
thus gets the benefit of contact with
the thought of many, of varied, and always
of authoritative, personalities. In
the third place, the <i>textile trade is
peculiarly an international trade</i>, the
raw materials often traveling from one
end of the world to the other before
manufacture, and making as long a
journey in the finished form, before they
reach the consumer, and the international
character of the Britannica
gives equal weight to the articles which
deal with the textiles and with the
markets of all countries—a statement
which it would certainly not be safe to
make about any other book.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Textile Fibres and their Treatment</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Fibers</span> (Vol. 10, p. 309), by
C. F. Cross, whose name has been much
before the public in connection with the
recent scientific investigation
of the
subject, compares
the fibres yielded by
all the vegetable
and animal substances
used in textiles. The 18
microscopic photographs on the full
page plates (facing pp. 310 and
311) and the table of vegetable
fibres (p. 311) should be carefully
studied. <span class='sc'>Cellulose</span> (Vol. 5, p. 606)
deals with the “body” of cotton,
flax, hemp and jute fibres. <span class='sc'>Carding</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 324) deals with the brushing
and combing of fibres. <span class='sc'>Spinning</span> (Vol.
25, p. 685) covers both cotton and
linen, and it is curious to note from
this article that in preparing yarns for
the exquisite Dacca muslins one pound
of cotton has been spun into a thread
252 miles long; while the article <span class='sc'>Dacca</span>
says that a piece 15 feet by 3 was once
woven that weighed only 900 grains.
<span class='sc'>Yarn</span> (Vol. 28, p. 906) deals with cotton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>woollen and silk yarns. <span class='sc'>Weaving</span> (Vol.
28, p. 440), by Prof. T. W. Fox, author
of <i>Mechanics of Weaving</i>, and Alan
Cole, is the first article you should read
in a group dealing with processes applied
to more than one material. The first
section is on the various combinations of
warp and weft, and contains 23 illustrations
showing the chief weaving
“schemes.” A section on weaving machinery
follows, and then one on weaving
as an art, illustrated with a number of
reproductions of famous specimens of
hand-loom work. The whole article is
full of practical every-day information
of the kind the merchant and manufacturer
wants to know. <span class='sc'>Bleaching</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 49) describes the chemical processes
which have expedited the bleaching
of cotton, wool, linen and silk, which
it used to take all summer to complete.
<span class='sc'>Dyeing</span> (Vol. 8, p. 744), by Prof.
Hummel, author of <i>The Dyeing of
Textile Fabrics</i>, and Prof. Knecht,
author of <i>A Manual of Dyeing</i>, is
another of the thorough articles which
entitle the Britannica to rank as a great
original work on textiles. Every dye is
separately treated, and the latest models
of dyeing machinery are carefully described.
<span class='sc'>Finishing</span> (Vol. 10, p. 378)
deals with the processes used for cotton,
woollens, worsteds, pile fabrics, silks and
yarns. <span class='sc'>Textile-Printing</span> (Vol. 26, p.
694) is by Prof. Knecht and Alan Cole,
author of <i>Ornament in European Silks</i>,
and not only describes all the styles of
printing, but gives sixty recipes for
various shades of colour. The full page
plates reproduce fine specimens of early
printing. The art of textile-printing “is
very ancient, probably originating in the
East. It has been practised in China
and India from time immemorial, and the
Chinese, at least, are known to have
made use of engraved wood-blocks many
centuries before any kind of printing was
known in Europe.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cotton and Cotton Fabrics</div>

<p class='c007'>The elaborate article <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> (Vol.
7, p. 256) begins by discussing the peculiar
twist of the hairs on the cotton
seed which by facilitating
spinning gives
cotton its predominant
position as a
textile material. The section on cultivation,
by W. G. Freeman, deals with
the soils, bedding, planting, hoeing and
picking, then with ginning and baling.
A section on diseases and pests of the
cotton plant follows, then a discussion
of the improvement of yield by seed
selection. The section on marketing and
supply is by Prof. Chapman, and his
practical study of “futures,” “options,”
and “straddles” shows how greatly the
movement of prices is affected by speculation
and often by artificial manipulation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cotton Manufacturing</span> (Vol. 7, p.
281) describes the industry in England,
that of the United States, with a special
section on the recent developments in
the two Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama,
and also the mills in Germany, France,
Russia, Switzerland, Italy and in other
countries, including India, China and
Japan. It is interesting to note (p. 293)
that “Americans were making vast
strides in industrial efficiency even before
the period when American theories
and American enterprise were monopolizing
in a wonderful degree the attention
of the business world” abroad. As far
back as 1875 progress in the United
States was so rapid that the production
for each operative had increased during
the ten years 1865–75, by 100% in Massachusetts
as against only 23% in England.
One explanation of American success is
that the American employer “tries to
save in labour but not in wages, if a
generalization may be ventured. The
good workman gets high pay, but he is
kept at tasks requiring his powers and
is not suffered to waste his time doing
the work of unskilled or boy labour.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cotton Spinning Machinery</span> (Vol.
7, p. 301) describes all the machines in
great detail and contains a number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>full-page plates and other illustrations.
<span class='sc'>Mercerizing</span> (Vol. 18, p. 150) is another
important article.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wool, Linen and Silk</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Wool, Worsted and Woollen Manufactures</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 805) is by Prof.
Aldred F. Barker. The development in
wool production of
various countries is
first described and
then the wool fibre
is studied and microscopic photographs
reproduced to show the structure of
different varieties. A diagram of a
fleece shows the qualities obtained from
various parts of the animal, ranging from
the shoulders, where the finest is found,
to the hind quarters. Lamb, hogg and
wether wools are compared and the
article discusses shearing, classing, sorting,
scouring, drying, teasing, burring,
mule spinning, combing, drawing and
spinning. The centres of the industry
are then compared, with details as to the
special products of each. The article
contains illustrations of a number of
machines. Articles dealing with certain
sources of wool or of the wool-like hair
used in textiles, and with the finished
products, are: <span class='sc'>Alpaca</span> (Vol. 1, p. 721),
the history of its manufacture being “one
of the romances of commerce;” <span class='sc'>Mohair</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 647), which deals with the
hair of the Angora goat, familiar from
discussions of the Underwood Tariff bill,
and dealing with its weaving and the
imitations of the cloth; <span class='sc'>Llama</span> (Vol.
16, p. 827); and the articles <span class='sc'>Guanaco</span>
(Vol. 12, p. 649) and <span class='sc'>Vicugna</span> (Vol. 28,
p. 47), on the two wild animals from
whose hair high priced materials, extraordinarily
warm and light, are woven.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Flax</span> (Vol. 10, p. 484) describes the
cultivation of the crops which are harvested
by being “pulled,” roots and all,
instead of being cut, the process of separating
the capsules from the branches, and
the subsequent stages of preparation.
<span class='sc'>Linen and Linen Manufactures</span> (Vol.
16, p. 724), by Thomas Woodhouse, takes
up the story where the flax fibre is ready
for market and carries it to the point
where the yarn is delivered for weaving.
The winding, warping, dressing and
beaming, and the looms employed, are
virtually the same processes and machines
that are used for cotton. The
article states that the finest linen threads
used for lace are produced by Belgian
hand spinners who can only get the
desired results by working in damp cellars,
the spinner being guided by touch
alone, as the filament is too fine for him
to see. This thread is said to have been
sold for as much as $72 an ounce.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jute</span> (Vol. 15, p. 603) deals with the
vegetable fibre which ranks, in its industrial
importance, next after cotton
and flax and with the processes employed
in its manufacture.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Silk</span> (Vol. 25, p. 96) contains illustrations
of cocoons and worms, microscopic
photographs of fibre, and pictures
of the moths which produce wild silk.
The section on the fibre and its production
and preparation is by Frank
Warner, president of the Silk Association
of Great Britain and Ireland; and
that on the silk trade by Arthur Mellor,
a well known manufacturer of Macclesfield,
the great British center. The degree
of fineness to which silk thread can
be spun is stated (Vol. 28, p. 906) to
be such that 450,000 yards of thread
have been produced from one pound of
silk, and this is slightly in excess of
the fineness of the Dacca cotton thread
already mentioned as producing 252
miles for a pound. But at Cambrai the
lace maker’s linen thread already described
has been made as fine as 272
miles to the pound, and the drawing of
platinum wire to the fifty-thousandth
part of an inch in thickness (Vol. 28, p.
738) seems hardly more wonderful than
this. Spider silk is as valuable as the
best qualities of the silkworm product,
but spiders are such fierce cannibals that
it is necessary to keep each one in a
separate cage, and the cost of doing
this has prevented the fibre from being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>generally used (Vol. 25, p. 664). Artificial
or “viscose” silk is described in
the article <span class='sc'>Cellulose</span> (Vol. 5, p. 609),
and is a textile of which the importance
is rapidly increasing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Felting is an even older textile process
than weaving, just as weaving, which no
doubt originated in basket making (Vol.
3, p. 481) is older than spinning. The
article <span class='sc'>Felt</span> (Vol. 10, p. 245) deals with
asphalted felts used for roofing as well
as with the hat felts; and the article <span class='sc'>Hat</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 60) gives further details as to
both woollen and fur felts and describes
the machinery for hatmaking, which
originated in the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Save that gold, silver and other metals
are occasionally used in cloth or gauze,
<span class='sc'>Asbestos</span> (Vol. 2, p. 714) is the only
mineral employed in textiles, and its
value for jacketing steam pipes and
boilers and for insulating fabrics and fireproofing
gives it great importance.
<span class='sc'>Ramie</span> (Vol. 22, p. 875) is not so
largely used in textiles, but experiments
in the production of better fibre are
being made.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Shoddy</span> (Vol. 24, p. 992) is an article
which shows how unfair it is to treat the
re-manufacture of “devilled” fabric as
an illegitimate if not absolutely fraudulent
branch of the textile industry, for
really serviceable cloths are woven from
it, and masses of poor people who would
otherwise be in rags are thus comfortably
clad. “Mungo,” another re-manufactured
cloth, is described (Vol. 28, p.
906) in the article <span class='sc'>Yarn</span>. Pine-apple
fibre is described (Vol. 10, p. 311) as of
exceptional fineness and is used in yarn
cloths of the best quality. The article
<span class='sc'>Pine-apple</span> (Vol. 21, p. 625) describes
its culture. <span class='sc'>Sisal Hemp</span> (Vol. 25, p.
158) is used in bagging as well as cordage,
and the same is true of <span class='sc'>Phormium</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 471), sometimes called New
Zealand flax. Paper pulp yields a yarn
which is used in some cheap fabrics as
described (Vol. 5, p. 609) in the article
<span class='sc'>Cellulose</span> already mentioned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Textile Merchandise</div>

<p class='c007'>The many varieties of woven cloths
are described in the articles already mentioned
in the manufacture of cotton,
linen, wool, and silk,
and in articles on
special fabrics. <span class='sc'>Hosiery</span>
(Vol. 13, p.
788) covers the textiles that are produced
by knitting or looping, and gives an
account, with illustrations, of the machinery
employed. <span class='sc'>Net</span> (Vol. 19, p.
412) covers the textiles of which the
mesh is knotted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lace</span> (Vol. 16, p. 37), by Alan Cole,
contains some of the most beautiful full-page
plates and other illustrations to be
found in the Britannica, and is a very
full treatise on the history and the present
state of the lacemaking art.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Flannel</span> (Vol. 10, p. 480) describes
the true flannels made from wool, and
<span class='sc'>Flannelette</span> (Vol. 10, p. 481) the cotton
imitations and the new fire-resisting
fabrics of this class. <span class='sc'>Drill</span> (Vol. 8, p.
580) covers both the cotton and linen
tissues sold under this name. <span class='sc'>Crepe</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 379) mentions the curious
fact that the Chinese and Japanese
makers of soft crepe guard their secret
processes, which are still unknown to
western manufacturers, so carefully that
the different stages of their production
are carried on in towns far distant from
one another.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Carpet</span> (Vol. 5, p. 392) contains full-page
plates of rare specimens and describes
pile carpets, flat-surfaced carpets
and the printed carpetings.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tapestry</span> (Vol. 26, p. 403) deals with
another luxurious branch of the textile
industry, and is illustrated with photographs
of the finest specimens and
with pictures showing the methods of
weaving. <span class='sc'>Brocade</span> (Vol. 4, p. 620)
describes and illustrates this stately class
of fabrics. <span class='sc'>Embroidery</span> (Vol. 9, p. 309)
with six full-page plates and <span class='sc'>Shawl</span> (Vol.
24, p. 814) deal with other art textiles.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tartan</span> (Vol. 26, p. 431) describes
the colours and patterns of all Scottish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>clan tartans. <span class='sc'>Damask</span> (Vol. 7, p. 785)
discusses this fine class of fabrics, the
weaving of which is the subject of a
special section (Vol. 28, p. 454) of the
article <span class='sc'>Weaving</span>. The enormous consumption
of coarse bags for the packing
of raw cotton and of sugar gives importance
to the articles <span class='sc'>Bagging</span> (Vol.
3, p. 200) and <span class='sc'>Sacking and Sack Manufacture</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 975). <span class='sc'>Canvas</span> (Vol.
5, p. 223) discusses sail cloth and artists’
canvas, and <span class='sc'>Tarpaulin</span> (Vol. 26, p. 430)
deals with waterproof covers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Seventy Articles on Special Fabrics</div>

<p class='c007'>It is unnecessary to describe one by
one the seventy articles on other fabrics
and tissues, ranging through the alphabet
from Alpaca to
Velveteen; but they
are all included in
the list at the end of
this chapter, and all
are fully described in the Britannica.
<span class='sc'>Costume</span> (Vol. 7, p. 224) is a long and
important article, with a full page plate
and many other illustrations. The section
on dress in general is by T. A.
Joyce, of the British Museum staff, that
on ancient costumes by H. S. Jones,
director of the British School at Rome,
and that on modern costume by Oswald
Barron, editor of <i>The Ancestor</i>. The
account of underclothing is of especial
interest, as most books on costume altogether
neglect this branch of the subject.
Another section of this article is on
national and official costumes by W.
Alison Phillips, principal assistant editor
of the Britannica. The study of
ceremonial robes is carried into further
detail by the article <span class='sc'>Robe</span> (Vol. 23, p.
408), with its five richly colored plates,
in one of which the judicial robes of the
U. S. Supreme Court Justices are shown.
Liturgical vestments are dealt with in
<span class='sc'>Vestments</span> (Vol. 28, p. 27) and in a
series of articles such as <span class='sc'>Dalmatic</span> (Vol.
7, p. 776) and <span class='sc'>Alb</span> (Vol. 1, p. 497).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Inventors of Textile Machinery and Great Textile Merchants</div>

<p class='c007'>Among the biographies which are of
interest in connection with textiles are
those of <span class='sc'>Arkwright, Richard</span> (Vol. 2,
p. 556), the barber who invented the
spinning frame; <span class='sc'>Cartwright, Edmund</span>,
(Vol. 5, p. 425), inventor of the power
loom; <span class='sc'>Crompton,
Samuel</span> (Vol. 7, p.
486), inventor of
the spinning mule;
<span class='sc'>Salt, Titus</span> (Vol.
23, p. 87), who
created the alpaca industry; <span class='sc'>Strutt,
Jedediah</span> (Vol. 25, p. 1044), who did much
to perfect the manufacture of cotton; and
of <span class='sc'>Whitney, Eli</span> (Vol. 28, p. 611), who
went from Yale to Savannah to secure a
position as school teacher and then, being
disappointed, turned his attention to
a device for separating the cotton fibre
from the seeds and refuse, and invented
the gin which has “profoundly influenced
American industrial economic and
social history.” Another name of a great
American inventor who individually rendered
great services to the textile industry
is that of <span class='sc'>Howe, Elias</span> (Vol. 13, p.
835), who invented the sewing machine.
You will also be interested in the lives
of successful merchants such as <span class='sc'>Canynges,
William</span> (Vol. 5, p. 223), the
great 15th Century cloth manufacturer
who became a clergyman after making
a large fortune; <span class='sc'>Mackintosh, Charles</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 250), who introduced lightweight
waterproof garments; <span class='sc'>Wanamaker,
John</span> (Vol. 28, p. 302), who began
life as an errand boy in a book store; <span class='sc'>Field,
Marshall</span> (Vol. 10, p. 322), who when
Chicago was a comparatively unimportant
city founded there what has become
the finest dry goods store in the world;
<span class='sc'>Stewart, A. T.</span> (Vol. 25, p. 912), who
after studying for the ministry in Dublin,
immigrated to New York and gradually
built up the largest retail store in
the city; <span class='sc'>Pease, Edward</span> (Vol. 21, p.
31), founder of a famous Quaker family
of textile manufacturers in England; and
<span class='sc'>Claflin, H. B.</span> (Vol. 6, p. 418), who came
from Worcester, Mass., to New York
where he for years controlled “the greatest
mercantile business in the world.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>If you turn to the Article <span class='sc'>Worcester</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 823) you will note the
associations of the locality with Elias
Howe, Eli Whitney, Samuel Crompton,
already mentioned, L. J. Knowles,
another inventor who helped to perfect
the power loom, and Erastus Bigelow,
who invented the carpet-weaving machine
(Vol. 6, p. 530) and was one of
the incorporators of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Other lives of
successful textile makers and dealers are
those of <span class='sc'>Rylands, John</span> (Vol. 23, p.
950), founder of the largest cotton mills
in Lancashire; <span class='sc'>Dexter, Timothy</span> (Vol.
8, p. 141), the eccentric New England
merchant of the 18th Century who beat
his wife for not weeping heartily enough
at the rehearsal of his funeral; <span class='sc'>Horrocks,
John</span> (Vol. 13, p. 712), the great
English cotton manufacturer who was
far ahead of his time and died of brain
fever produced by overwork in 1804;
<span class='sc'>Worth, C. F.</span> (Vol. 28, p. 834), the
famous Paris dressmaker who began
life as a London draper’s apprentice;
<span class='sc'>Whitely, William</span> (Vol. 28, p. 605),
“the Universal Provider,” of London;
and <span class='sc'>Tata, J. N.</span> (Vol. 26, p. 448), the

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>A Change in Public Opinion</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>An appreciation of the science
of mechanical engineering is so
indispensable to the manufacture
and sale of machinery that the
reader of this Guide might simply
have been referred to the chapter <i>For
Engineers</i> as covering the industry, if it
were not that the Britannica contains (as
the list at the end of this chapter shows)
a great number of articles dealing with
individual machines. The amount of
space which the new Britannica devotes
to mechanical subjects, and the great
number of expert contributors whose collaboration
was enlisted in this connection,
are significant from more than one
point of view. All other general encyclopaedias,
including earlier editions of
the Britannica itself, seem to have been
influenced by the old-fashioned fetish of
“pure” scholarship and “pure” science,
treating theory as a
subject of study
much more dignified
than the application
of knowledge to the practical
affairs of life. Until recent days the
great universities of such important
manufacturing countries as England,
Germany and France were almost exclusively
devoted to the teaching of philosophy,
history, Greek and Latin, mathematics
and pure or natural science.
The older universities of the United
States, too, were for a long time reluctant
to recognize the growing importance of
technical education, and the necessity,
apart from technical education, of giving
the general student some knowledge of
mechanics. And it is a significant fact that
the Britannica, the first encyclopaedia
that has ever been published by a university,
should be, although it comes
from one of the oldest of all universities,
the first to give full recognition to the
importance of this department of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men in the machinery trade will welcome
this change of attitude in the Britannica,
not because they crave a public
acknowledgment of the great share of
the world’s work that they are doing,
but because public ignorance of mechanical
subjects results in the abuse of machines
and in unreasonable complaints
against manufacturers when improperly
used machinery fails to do its work. A
curious illustration of the general disregard
of the subject is supplied by the
fact—as true of the United States as of
England, Germany or France—that representative
government is, in practice,
chiefly government by lawyers, and that
in this age of machinery it is the exception
to find in the cabinet which directs
the affairs of any country, a single member
who has any knowledge of mechanics.
The same ignorance is conspicuous in
newspaper offices. Even the most dignified
dailies seem unable to deal with any
news that has to do with machinery without
making ridiculous blunders.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Influence of Automobiles</div>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately, the automobile is beginning
to stimulate interest in practical mechanics,
for no one can attempt to drive
his own car, or even
to obtain proper
service from his
chauffeur and from
garage workmen, without realizing that
he failed, at school, to learn some of the
most useful of lessons. Before long the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>authorities responsible for our public
schools may realize that it is absolute
barbarism to neglect mechanical teaching
as they do; and the new Britannica is
already doing good service in stimulating
public interest in the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>An examination of the articles mentioned
in detail in the following summary,
and a glance at the long list of articles at
the end of the chapter, will show the
comprehensiveness with which the Britannica
treats all types of machinery. The
materials employed are, logically, the
first subjects upon which information
will be desired.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Iron and Steel</span> (Vol. 14, p. 801), by
Professor H. M. Howe of Columbia University,
is a mine of information about
the properties and uses of the different
varieties of the indispensable metal of
which 50,000,000 tons per annum are
employed. In the manufacture of electrical
apparatus <span class='sc'>Copper</span> (Vol. 7, p. 102)
is largely employed, and for this reason
alone the article has great value for the
manufacturer. Almost as important is
<span class='sc'>Alloys</span> (Vol. 1, p. 704). Its chief author,
Sir William Chandler Roberts-Austen, is
the greatest living authority on alloys,
and it is full of interesting facts about
new admixtures.</p>

<p class='c007'>The processes of <span class='sc'>Annealing, Hardening
and Tempering</span> are described in J.
G. Horner’s article under that title (Vol.
2, p. 70). This authority explains clearly
the difference between hardening and
tempering and gives valuable advice as to
the most efficient methods of hardening.
<span class='sc'>Founding</span> (Vol. 10, p. 743), also by J. G.
Horner, is fully illustrated, and the question
of the highest economies of machine
moulding are among the practical matters
considered. <span class='sc'>Forging</span> (Vol. 10, p.
663), with 19 illustrations, discusses fullering,
swaging, upsetting, bending, welding,
pinching, cutting-off, and die-forging.
There is also a separate article,
<span class='sc'>Welding</span> (Vol. 28), in which the section
on <i>Electric Welding</i> is written by Elihu
Thomson, who invented the process. A
table of energy used in electric welding is
added. See also <span class='sc'>Brazing and Soldering</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 463).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Manufacturing Methods</div>

<p class='c007'>The designer of machinery will find
much practical information in <span class='sc'>Drawing</span>,
<i>Drawing Office Work</i> (Vol. 8, p. 556), and
<span class='sc'>Sun-Copying</span> (Vol.
26, p. 93). It is a
remarkable fact that
prints identical in
scale with the originals are now made up
to a length of 22 feet.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bearings</span> (Vol. 3, p. 578), illustrated,
is written by Professor Dalby of the
South Kensington Central Technical
College. The article <span class='sc'>Tool</span> (Vol. 27, p.
14), by J. G. Horner, is 33 pages in
length and has 79 illustrations. The
whole subject is completely covered. In
the section on <i>Machine Tools</i> are discussed
turning lathes, reciprocating machines,
machines with drill and bore
holes, milling machines, machines for
cutting the teeth of gear wheels, grinding
machinery, sawing machines, shearing
and punching machines, hammers and
presses, portable tools, appliances, wood-working
machines, and measurement. In
regard to the last subject great advances
have lately been made. A thousandth of
an inch is now considered a coarse dimension
in the machine shop, where gauges
within one five-thousandth of an inch are
often used. This article is an invaluable
manual for the machine-shop, and supplies
many hints which should be given
to workmen, for, to use the author’s
words, “a clumsy workman is as much
out of place in a modern machine-shop as
he would be in a watch-factory.” Another
article useful to the mechanic is
<span class='sc'>Screw</span> (Vol. 24, p. 477), with 10 illustrations,
by J. G. Horner, with a section on
the <i>Errors of Screws</i>, by the late Henry
A. Rowland, the American physicist,
whose skill, shown in the construction of
dividing engines of extraordinary precision
and delicacy, made him famous the
world over. See also <span class='sc'>Graduation</span> (Vol.
12, p. 312).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Engines and Motors</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The articles on the prime-movers are
an important and noteworthy part of the
new Britannica. Professor Ewing, of
Cambridge University, contributes <span class='sc'>Air
Engine</span> (Vol. 1, p.
443) and <span class='sc'>Steam Engine</span>
(Vol. 25, p.
818), both fully illustrated.
The latter has a most interesting
preliminary historical account of engines
from the aeolipile of Hero of Alexandria
(about 130 B.C.) to the steam-turbine,
the most modern type of all. The newest
forms of internal combustion motors, <span class='sc'>Oil
Engine</span> (Vol. 20, p. 35) and <span class='sc'>Gas Engine</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 495), are described by Dugald
Clerk, inventor of the Clerk cycle gas
engine, and the articles are fully illustrated.
Under <span class='sc'>Hydraulics</span> (Vol. 14, p.
91) will be found complete information
as to the construction of water-pressure
engines, water-wheels, turbines, and also
pumps. The article is written by Professor
W. C. Unwin, and has been universally
declared to be the best treatise on
the subject that has yet appeared. There
is a separate illustrated article <span class='sc'>Water-Motors</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 382), by Professor
Beare of Edinburgh University. See also
<span class='sc'>Windmill</span> (Vol. 28, p. 710).</p>

<p class='c007'>Designers and constructors of electrical
machinery will be greatly interested
in C. C. Hawkins’ illustrated article
<span class='sc'>Dynamo</span> (Vol. 8, p. 764), which explains
fully how the dynamo is constructed and
gives its history from Faraday’s discovery
of the principle in 1831. Dr. Louis Bell,
of the General Electric Co., writes on
<span class='sc'>Motors, Electric</span> (Vol. 18, p. 910).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Machinery for Special Purposes</div>

<p class='c007'>In hundreds of articles on manufacturing
and manufactured products there are
excellent descriptions of the machinery
employed. <span class='sc'>Cotton-Spinning Machinery</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 301), by Professor Fox, of
Manchester University, gives details,
with illustrations, of the modern systems
of spinning, all founded on the inventions
of Paul, Arkwright, Hargreaves and
Crompton, while an historical account of
primitive machines as well as much practical
information, will be found under
<span class='sc'>Spinning</span> (Vol. 25, p. 685). <span class='sc'>Weaving</span>
has a section <i>Weaving Machinery</i> (Vol.
28, p. 443). An account
of the special
machinery and appliances
used in the
manufacture of woollens
is included in Professor Barker’s
illustrated article <span class='sc'>Wool, Worsted and
Woollen Manufactures</span> (Vol. 28, p.
805). In <span class='sc'>Hosiery</span> (Vol. 13, p. 788) we
learn about framework knitting and
warp-knitting machines. It is recorded
that up to the middle of the 19th century
only a flat web could be knitted, and that
a circular knitting machine of American
origin is the type of machine on which is
produced the seamless hosiery of to-day.
This was introduced by J. W. Lamb in
1863. <span class='sc'>Rope and Rope Making</span> (Vol. 23,
p. 713), by Thomas Woodhouse, of the
Dundee Technical College, is richly illustrated
with pictures of the most modern
type of machinery for the manufacture of
fibre and wire ropes. The various machines
and apparatus for sugar making
are carefully described in <span class='sc'>Sugar</span>, <i>Sugar
Manufacture</i> (Vol. 26, p. 35). For milling
machinery see <span class='sc'>Flour and Flour
Manufacture</span> (Vol. 10, p. 548), by
George F. Zimmer, author of <i>Mechanical
Handling of Material</i>. The latest designs
in agricultural machines, with illustrations,
as well as a history of their development,
will be found under <span class='sc'>Plough and
Ploughing</span> (Vol. 21, p. 850), <span class='sc'>Sowing</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 523), <span class='sc'>Harrow</span> (Vol. 13, p.
27), <span class='sc'>Reaping</span> (Vol. 22, p. 944), <span class='sc'>Thrashing</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 887), etc. It is a matter
of interest that the first successful reaping-machine
was invented by a Scotch
clergyman in 1826. For machinery used
in the modern dairy see <span class='sc'>Dairy and
Dairy Products</span> (Vol. 7, p. 750). The
germ of the sewing machine dates back
to 1755, and the whole story of its development
is told in <span class='sc'>Sewing Machines</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 744).

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='c014'>FOR MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS OF METALS, HARDWARE, GLASS AND CHINA</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Elisée Reclus, the great French
student of the origins of civilization,
says, in the Britannica
article <span class='sc'>Fire</span> (Vol. 10, p. 399), that “human
culture may be said to have begun
with fire, of which the uses increased
in the same ratio as culture
itself.” The industries grouped in
the present chapter all depend upon the
curiously diverse effects of heat; the softening
and tempering of metals, the hardening
of clay and the changes by which
sand becomes glass. It is for the reader
himself to decide whether he wishes to
begin his course of reading by a study of
the article <span class='sc'>Heat</span> (Vol. 13, p. 135), and
the allied articles to which it refers, and
thus to understand how temperature
plays its dominant part in the most useful
of manufacturing processes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Knowledge in “Layers”</div>

<p class='c007'>It is, indeed, one of the most attractive
features of the Britannica that it presents
knowledge in <i>layers</i>. In text-books, the
theoretical and practical
aspects of an
industry are so interwoven
that you
cannot separate them. But in the Britannica,
if you desire only to examine the
finished products of any branch of industry,
as you might see them and hear
them described at an exhibition or in a
manufacturer’s sample room, you can
turn to articles and sections of articles in
which critical comment and elaborate illustrations
put clearly before you the
varieties of, for example, plated ware,
china or glass. Proceeding to the next
“layer,” you find technical information
about the manufacture of these and all
other goods; you have been permitted to
pass from the sample room into the factory,
which is not usually so easy of access.
And in the scientific articles you
arrive at the very substratum and foundation
of knowledge; you have what the
experts in the factory could not give you
if they would: the clear teaching that
only the great masters of science can
supply.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manufacturer, of course, absolutely
<i>needs</i> to know all that can be
learned about the origin of his materials
and the principles upon which his processes
are based. But the dealer, in his
turn, will be a shrewder buyer, a more
convincing salesman and a better manager
of the salesmen under him, if he
knows the whole history of his wares, of
the ingredients that enter into their composition
and of their manufacture. Factory
experience is hardly more universal
among wholesale men, most of whom
begin as clerks, than among retailers, and
it is impossible for a business man who
has got his foot fairly on the ladder to
drop his work and go through an apprenticeship
or take a thorough course at
a technical college. If, however, he will
for a few months devote his spare time to
the studies he can pursue, unaided, in
the Britannica, the insight he obtains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>will give a new value to all the knowledge
he picks up in the course of his business.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Physics and Chemistry</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Some of the Authorities</div>

<p class='c007'>The departments of physics and physical
chemistry are of course those in
which the Britannica’s scientific contents
especially interest
those to whom this
chapter is addressed,
and the authority of
the Britannica in those departments of
knowledge is shown by a very striking
fact. You may remember that Alfred
Nobel, the great Swedish chemist, who
made a fortune by the invention and
manufacture of dynamite, devoted $9,000,000
to the establishment of the annual
Nobel prizes, to be awarded, irrespective
of nationality, for eminence in
scientific research and in the cause of
peace. In physics and chemistry, <i>Britannica
contributors have won, in eleven years,
seven of these prizes</i>, these winners being:
in 1901, Prof. J. H. van’t Hoff, of the
University of Berlin; in 1902, Prof.
Lorentz, of the University of Leiden; in
1904, Lord Rayleigh, Chancellor of the
University of Cambridge; in 1906, Sir J. J.
Thomson, of the University of Cambridge;
in 1909, Prof. Ostwald, of the University
of Leipzig; in 1911, Prof. Van der Waals,
of the University of Amsterdam. In
other words, you find
that the scientific
committee who
award the Nobel
prizes select for these unique distinctions
the same men whom the editor of the
Britannica selected as contributors. Now
apply another test, in connection with
the subject matter of this chapter. What
is, by general consent, the most exquisitely
finished product of any of the industries
under discussion in the present
section? To this question there can be
but one answer: Optical glass. Where is
the best glass made? At the Zeiss Works
in Jena, Germany. Very well, Dr. Otto
Henker and Dr. Eppenstein, both of the
scientific staff of the Zeiss Works, wrote
the optical articles in the Britannica
which deal with the lens and with aberration
in lenses. You should therefore remember,
in reading the Britannica, that
whether you are only going as far as the
uppermost layer of knowledge, or reaching
down to the very foundations of
science, the men whose articles you are
reading command the respect that you
can pay to them by giving your very
closest attention. Do not imagine that
because the book contains forty-four
million words, it is made to be skimmed;
every article in it is condensed; and you
cannot derive the fullest benefit from
your reading unless you feel, as you
would feel if you were fortunate enough
to be brought into personal contact with
any of these great men, that you have a
privilege of which you must make the
most.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Metals</div>

<p class='c007'>Other chapters of this Guide also deal
in detail with the scientific side of the industries
mentioned here; and in examining
the groups of industrial articles, those
dealing with metals claim first consideration.
The article <span class='sc'>Metal</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 198) is devoted
to classification only, and
would not occupy more than ten pages
of this Guide. It contains information
as to the physical properties of the metals,
including a table in which the specific
gravity of each of 42 metals is stated, a
table of comparative ductility under the
hammer, for rolling and for wire drawing,
a table of elasticities, and other tables
showing the ratio of expansion under
heat, the melting and boiling points, and
the relative thermic and electric conductivity.
A section is devoted to the action
of chemical agents upon the simple
metals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Metallurgy</span> (Vol. 18, p. 203), and
<span class='sc'>Electrometallurgy</span> (Vol. 9, p. 232), by
W. G. McMillan, lecturer on metallurgy
at Mason College, Birmingham, deal
with all the methods of smelting ores.
Your next reading should be the great
article <span class='sc'>Iron and Steel</span> (Vol. 14, p. 801),
by Prof. H. M. Howe, of Columbia University,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>containing as much matter as
would fill 110 pages of this Guide. At
the beginning of this article Prof. Howe
disposes of the much discussed question
as to the true distinction between iron
and steel, as to which there has been
great confusion. Before 1860, the word
“steel” was never applied to a metal that
could not be hardened by tempering. But
when the invention of the Bessemer and
open-hearth processes introduced a new
class of iron, “which lacked the essential
property of steel, the hardening power,
yet differed from the existing forms of
wrought iron in freedom from slag,” the
men interested in the new product did
not like to call it “wrought iron,” which
is what it really is, because that name
would confuse it with a lower-priced
grade of metal. They ought to have
coined a new word for it, but they appropriated
the name of steel—so that to-day
“steel” means either true steel or the
low-carbon, slagless variety of malleable
iron. The article is divided into 133 sections,
so that to analyze its contents
would swamp this chapter of the Guide,
but the reader will find in it the clearest
and most authoritative account of the
industry which has yet been published.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among articles on the commercial
metals are <span class='sc'>Copper</span> (Vol. 7, p. 102), <span class='sc'>Lead</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 314), <span class='sc'>Tin</span> (Vol. 26, p. 995),
<span class='sc'>Zinc</span> (Vol. 28, p. 981), <span class='sc'>Aluminium</span> (Vol.
1, p. 767), <span class='sc'>Nickel</span> (Vol. 19, p. 658), <span class='sc'>Antimony</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 127), and, on the
precious metals, <span class='sc'>Gold</span> (Vol. 12, p. 192),
<span class='sc'>Silver</span> (Vol. 25, p. 112), and <span class='sc'>Platinum</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 805).</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Alloys</span>, of which Sir W. C.
Roberts-Austen, long chemist of the
London Mint, is the chief contributor,
with its photomicrographic illustrations,
contains not only an account of the alloys
already generally used in the metal industries,
but also practical information
as to the experiments which have been
made recently with some of the newly
discovered rare earths. In the article
<span class='sc'>Metallography</span> (Vol. 18, p. 202), by
the same specialist, the microscopic examination
and photography of metals and
alloys is described.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among articles on the metallic compounds
are <span class='sc'>Brass</span> (Vol. 4, p. 433), in
which “Dutch metal,” “Mannheim gold,”
“similor” and “pinchbeck” are described;
<span class='sc'>Bronze</span> (Vol. 4, p. 639), which deals with
steel bronze, phosphor bronze, and other
combinations; <span class='sc'>Fusible Metal</span> (Vol. 11,
p. 369) is an important compound.
<span class='sc'>Pewter</span> (Vol. 21, p. 338), by Malcolm
Bell, author of <i>Pewter Plate</i>, etc., is of
historical interest, and of value to the
dealer or collector, while he who wishes
to distinguish between the older and the
more modern electroplated ware is referred
to the article <span class='sc'>Sheffield Plate</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 824), also by Malcolm Bell.
<span class='sc'>Electroplating</span> (Vol. 9, p. 237) describes
the art that put an end to the
Sheffield plate industry. Other methods
of coating metals are given under <span class='sc'>Galvanized
Iron</span> (Vol. 11, p. 428), <span class='sc'>Tin Plate
and Terne Plate</span> (Vol. 26, p. 1000), and
<span class='sc'>Gilding</span> (Vol. 12, p. 13). The art of
making gold-leaf is described in <span class='sc'>Goldbeating</span>
(Vol. 12, p. 202).</p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to manufacturing processes
there are the separate articles: <span class='sc'>Forging</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 663), with 19 illustrations;
<span class='sc'>Founding</span> (Vol. 10, p. 743), with 11 illustrations;
<span class='sc'>Annealing, Hardening
and Tempering</span> (Vol. 2, p. 70), and
<span class='sc'>Brazing and Soldering</span> (Vol. 4, p. 463).
These four articles are by J. G. Horner.
And see <span class='sc'>Welding</span> (Vol. 28, p. 500), also
by Mr. Horner, with a section on <i>Electro-Welding</i>,
by Elihu Thomson, inventor of
the process of electric welding and expert
for the General Electric Co. The article
<span class='sc'>Tool</span> (Vol. 27, p. 14), another of Mr.
Horner’s valuable contributions, has 79
illustrations and possesses special interest
for the manufacturer of metal-ware as well
as the dealer in hardware.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Metal-Ware</div>

<p class='c007'>Coming now to the production of metal
wares, the article <span class='sc'>Metal-Work</span> (Vol. 18,
p. 205), beautifully illustrated, is the
work of three noted experts. The late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>J. H. Middleton, Slade Professor of Fine
Art, Cambridge University, writes on
<i>Methods of Manipulation
in Metal Work</i>
and tells of the metal
work of Greece, Italy, Spain, Germany,
France, England, Persia and Damascus.
J. S. Gardner, an expert metal worker,
deals with <i>Modern Art Metal Work</i>, and
J. G. Horner contributes the section on
<i>Industrial Metal Working</i>, in which he
deals with <i>Plater’s Work</i>, <i>Coppersmith’s
Work</i>, <i>Raised Work</i>, <i>Cast Work</i>, <i>Methods
of Union and Protection of Surfaces</i>. In
connection with the last mentioned subject,
see also <span class='sc'>Japanning</span> (Vol. 15, p. 275),
<span class='sc'>Lacquer</span> (Vol. 16, p. 53), and <span class='sc'>Painter-Work</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 457). Further information
about lacquering, with valuable
formulas, will be found in the article
<span class='sc'>Japan</span> (Vol. 15, p. 188). Some of the
ornamental forms of metal work are described
in <span class='sc'>Repoussé</span> (Vol. 23, p. 108), by
M. H. Spielmann, formerly editor of <i>The
Magazine of Art</i>; <span class='sc'>Inlaying</span> (Vol. 14, p.
574), and <span class='sc'>Damascening</span> (Vol. 7, p. 783).
See also <span class='sc'>Grille</span> (Vol. 12, p. 596).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Plate</span> (Vol. 21, p. 789), an article by
H. R. Hall, of the British Museum, H.
Stuart Jones, director of the British
School at Rome, and E. A. Jones, author
of <i>Old English Gold Plate</i>, etc., is a concise,
complete hand-book on work in silver
and gold of any class other than
those of personal ornaments and coins.
It is profusely illustrated with plates and
text-cuts, showing many exquisite models;
and the reader can master the details
of style in different periods and countries.
The subjects of the assay of gold and silver
plate and hall-marks are discussed,
the former being treated more fully in
<span class='sc'>Assaying</span> (Vol. 2, p. 776), by A. A. Blair,
chief chemist of the U. S. Geological
Survey. The article <span class='sc'>Roman Art</span>, by H.
Stuart Jones, has a section devoted to
<i>Work in Precious Metals</i> (Vol. 23, p. 483).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cutlery</span> (Vol. 7, p. 671) is one of the
articles pertaining specifically to hardware
manufacture and trade, in which
general processes of manufacture are described;
and of allied interest are <span class='sc'>Knife</span>
(Vol. 15, p. 850), <span class='sc'>Fork</span> (Vol. 10, p. 666),
<span class='sc'>Spoon</span> (Vol. 25, p. 733), <span class='sc'>Scissors</span> (Vol.

agricultural implements will be found
under their respective headings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Glassware</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Glass</span> (Vol. 12, p. 86) is most complete
in its consideration of the entire subject.
The introductory section by H. J. Powell,
of the Whitefriars
Glass Works, London,
author of <i>Glass
Making</i>, and W. Rosenhain, of the National
Physical Laboratory, London,
deals with the manufacture of optical
glass, blown glass and mechanically-pressed
glass. The necessary qualities of
each kind are stated and the newest processes
of manufacture described, with full
information about materials. The second
part of the article is devoted to the <i>History
of Glass Manufacture</i>, by Mr. Powell
and Alexander Nesbitt, who wrote the
well-known <i>Introduction</i> to the South
Kensington Museum Catalogue of Glass
Vessels. Egyptian, Assyrian, Roman,
Venetian, Bohemian and Oriental glass,
as well as the modern types, are exhaustively
described. The article is
splendidly illustrated. <span class='sc'>Drinking Vessels</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 580), by Dr. Charles H.
Read, of the British Museum, describes
old forms of glass cups and goblets. It is
most valuable for its information in regard
to styles of different countries and
periods, and the illustrations show many
types.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stained glass is the subject of the separate
article <span class='sc'>Glass, Stained</span> (Vol. 12, p.
105), illustrated, by the late Lewis F.
Day, author of <i>Windows, a Book about
Stained Glass</i>. It is both historical and
descriptive in its nature, deals with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>painted and stained glass, contains a table
of examples of important historical
stained glass, and treats of the latest
progress in the art, including the productions
of La Farge and L. C. Tiffany in
this country. The art of fitting and setting
of glass is described in <span class='sc'>Glazing</span> (Vol.
12, p. 116), illustrated, by James Bartlett.
Here we learn about the setting of
window glass, the use of glass in decoration,
systems of roof glazing and the use
of wire glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>Full information about glass for optical
purposes will be found under <span class='sc'>Lens</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 421), illustrated, by Dr. Otto
Henker, of the Carl Zeiss Factory, Jena,
Germany; <span class='sc'>Lighthouse</span>, <i>Optical Apparatus</i>
(Vol. 16, p. 633), illustrated, by W.
T. Douglass, who erected the Eddystone
and Bishop Rock lighthouses, and Nicholas
G. Gedye, chief engineer to the
Tyne Improvement Commission; <span class='sc'>Telescope</span>,

by H. Dennis Taylor and Sir
David Gill; <span class='sc'>Photography</span>, <i>Photographic
Objectives or Lenses</i> (Vol. 21, p. 507), illustrated,
by James Waterhouse; <span class='sc'>Spectacles</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 617).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chinaware, Pottery and Porcelain</div>

<p class='c007'>To those engaged in the china ware,
pottery or porcelain manufacture and
trade, the great article <span class='sc'>Ceramics</span> (Vol.
5, p. 703) will prove
a revelation. It is
the joint product of a number of experts,
both practical and
artistic, including William Burton, chairman,
Joint Committee of Pottery Manufacturers
of Great Britain, Henry R. H.
Hall and Robert Lockhart Hobson, both
of the British Museum, and A. Van de
Put and Bernard Rackham, both of the
Victoria and Albert Museum. It is 85,000
words in length and contains over a hundred
beautiful illustrations, including six
plates in colour. It deals fully with the
artistic and economic phases of the subject,
the methods of manufacture, the
different varieties of ceramics, their history,
decoration, etc. Japanese ceramics
are treated separately in <span class='sc'>Japan</span>, <i>Ceramics</i>
(Vol. 15, p. 183), illustrated, by the late
Capt. Frank Brinkley.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Clay</span> (Vol. 6, p. 472), by Dr. J. S.
Flett, describes the occurrence, composition
and properties of the various clays
used in ceramics.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Terracotta</span> (Vol. 26, p. 653), illustrated,
by William Burton and H. B.
Walters, of the British Museum, deals
with the artistic use to which baked clay
is put, while <span class='sc'>Tile</span> (Vol. 26, p. 971), illustrated,
also by William Burton, has great
practical value for the present-day manufacturer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Kaolin</span> (Vol. 15, p. 672), by F. W.
Rudler, of the Museum of Practical
Geology, London, deals specifically with
china clay and its preparation for the
market. <span class='sc'>Gilding</span> (Vol. 12, p. 13) contains
material on the subject of the gilding
of pottery and porcelain, and <span class='sc'>Painting</span>
has a section <i>Painting with Coloured Vitreous
Pastes</i> (Vol. 20, p. 484), by Prof. G.
B. Brown, of Edinburgh University, which
describes the use of these pastes in ceramics.
<span class='sc'>Enamel</span> (Vol. 9, p. 362), illustrated,
by Alexander Fisher, yields
equally valuable information for those
concerned with the decoration of
china.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <span class='sc'>Mural Decoration</span>, by Walter
Crane and William Morris, there is a section
devoted to <i>Wall-Linings of Glazed
Brick or Tiles</i> (Vol. 19, p. 17). Material
of great archaeological interest relating to
earthenware, etc., will be found in such
articles as <span class='sc'>Aegean Civilization</span> (Vol. 1,
p. 245), illustrated, by D. G. Hogarth, of
the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; <span class='sc'>Crete</span>,
<i>Archaeology</i> (Vol. 7, p. 421), illustrated, by
Arthur J. Evans, the famous Cretan explorer,

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='c014'>FOR MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS OF FURNITURE</span></h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Art and Industry</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>When you think of your home,
making a picture in your mind
of the familiar surroundings associated
in your memory with your
greatest pleasures, you are really thinking
of furniture. Tradition makes the
dwelling itself the tangible symbol of
home, because when a primitive tribe
ceased to be wanderers, the walls that
excluded wild beasts and inclement
weather and gave privacy were conspicuous
evidences of a change for the
better. But in our higher civilization our
way of thinking has changed. Nothing
seems to us more desolate than the bleak
surfaces and harsh angles of an unfurnished
house. Colour and softness and
the curved lines which we instinctively
love because they suggest softness come
into the dwelling with furniture, and culture
has progressed so far that the chair
or bed must be a delight to the eye as
well as to the weary
limbs, that the dinner
table and the
bookcase must be so
designed as to enhance the satisfaction
we find in refreshing body and mind.
You would not get so much pleasure as
you do from your Encyclopaedia Britannica
if its paper and print and pictures
and the colour and texture of the bindings
did not make it one of the chief
adornments of your home; the volumes
might be just as useful in a less pleasing
guise, but you would not feel the same
affection for the book.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Form and Embellishment</div>

<p class='c007'>To satisfy the spirit of home-love and
house-pride in the making of furniture is
an art, and the idea that furniture can
only be artistic when it is made by hand,
from a design that is to be used but once,
is as nonsensical as it would be to say
that a beautiful etching is not true art
because a press produces it and others
like it. “Fine art is everything which
man does or makes <i>in one way rather than
another</i>&#160;... in order to express and
arouse emotion&#160;... with results independent
of direct utility.” These words
from Sir Sidney Colvin’s delightful Britannica
article <span class='sc'>Fine Arts</span> (Vol. 10, p.
361), and another passage (p. 370), in
which he speaks of “the artificers who
produce wares primarily for use, in a
form, or with embellishments, that have
the <i>secondary virtue of giving pleasure</i>,”
might well be quoted to the supercilious
and superficial critic
who condemns every
product which machinery
has brought
within the reach of the less fortunately
situated. Furniture, made in one form
rather than another, because that one
form gives greater pleasure, is artistic
furniture whether it is made of machined
pine chemically stained or of handworked
and hand-polished rosewood.
The manufacturer and dealer who ingeniously
minimize the cost of production
and distribution are benefiting the
public just as truly as did Thomas Chippendale,
“at once an artist and a prosperous
man of business,” or Thomas
Sheraton, “the great artistic genius who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>lived in chronic poverty.” The adaptation
and variation of their ideas, under
modern conditions of manufacture, have
given pleasure to tens of thousands for
every one whose home was enriched by
the original products.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Related Subjects</div>

<p class='c007'>We have, then, in the furniture business,
the combination of an art with an
industry of the most practical and useful
kind, and this art is one which does more
than any other to “express and arouse”
the home-cherishing emotions which solidify
family life. The principles which
underlie architecture, sculpture, painting,
metal work, embroidery and the
weaving of patterns all affect the design
of furniture, since its contours and surfaces
are obtained by the application
of the structural
and decorative laws of all of them,
and it might therefore be said that the
only course of reading in the Britannica
which could fully justify the title of this
chapter would be one which covered all
these diverse fields. The reader can,
however, with the assistance of other
chapters of this Guide, easily find his
way to the Britannica’s articles on each
of these allied subjects, and an indication
of the articles dealing specifically with
furniture will at any rate serve his primary
purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Art Nouveau” School</div>

<p class='c007'>The keystone article <span class='sc'>Furniture</span> (Vol.
11, p. 363) is by James Penderel-Brodhurst,
one of the greatest of living authorities,
to whom many of the subsidiary
articles are also due. The 37 illustrations
on plate paper include two
large views of the most famous and resplendent
piece of furniture ever constructed,
the cylinder desk, now in the
Louvre Museum in Paris, made for Louis
XV by a number of “artist-artificers,”
the chief among them Oeben and Riesener,
with bronze mounts by Duplessis,
Winant and Hervieux. The article explains
the scanty attention paid to furniture
in ancient Egypt, Rome and Greece,
and throughout the Middle Ages in Western
Europe, as due to the routine of life
in centuries during which people spent
their days in the open air, and went to
bed as soon as it was dark, therefore
needing but few household appliances.
The Renaissance was the first era of
sumptuous and elaborately varied furniture;
and it was not until the 18th century
that the art of the cabinet-maker
was fully developed. The English periods
of Queen Anne and early Georgian craftsmanship
and the reigns of Louis XV and
Louis XVI brought the development to
its high-water-mark. Since then, there
has been no really
new departure except
the “art nouveau”
school, which
professed to be free from all traditions
and to seek inspiration from nature alone.
The revolution which was thus attempted
was not successful, and the permanent influence
of the movement will, in all probability,
be less notable for its effect upon
style than for the very great service it
rendered in reviving the use of oak.
Lightly polished, fumed or waxed, this
wood, which was so long neglected, is the
most effective that can be employed at
moderate cost.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beds</div>

<p class='c007'>The oldest and most indispensable of
all furnishings is treated in the article
<span class='sc'>Bed</span> (Vol. 3, p. 612). The Egyptians had
high bedsteads to which
they ascended by steps,
and the Assyrians, Medes
and Persians followed the same custom.
The Greek bed had a wooden frame, with
a board at the head, and bands of hide
laced across, upon which skins were laid.
At a later period, as vase-paintings show,
the Greeks used folding beds. Another
ancient application of an idea commonly
supposed to be of modern origin is found
in the Roman use of bronze beds, and
metal is so much more sanitary than
wood for this purpose that it seems
strange it was afterwards discarded for
many centuries. The bed of the Emperor
Eliogabalus was of solid silver,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>with counterpane and hangings of purple
embroidered in gold. In Pompeii wall-niches
for beds, like those still used in
Holland, are found, and were apparently
closed by sliding partitions as well as by
curtains. To our modern ideas, this arrangement
seems to have been disgustingly
devoid of ventilation, but the four-poster,
with its “tester” roof and its curtains,
which was widely used until the
middle of the 19th century, was not much
better. Mattresses developed very slowly,
for in the 18th century pea-shucks and
straw were the stuffing materials employed
in houses of prosperous people,
and hair had not come into use. The article
gives a full and interesting account
of the quaint custom, instituted by Louis
XI of France, and followed by many of
his royal successors, of a sovereign remaining
in bed while he received the
visits of his ministers and courtiers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chests and Chairs</div>

<p class='c007'>The chair, to us the commonest of objects,
did not come into general use until,
as the articles <span class='sc'>Bench</span> (Vol. 3, p. 715) and
<span class='sc'>Stool</span> (Vol. 25, p.
967) indicate, these
two had long been
the usual seats. The
<span class='sc'>Chest</span> (Vol. 6, p. 106) was also used as a
seat, and was the original form of wardrobe
before hanging space and drawers
were provided. The ecclesiastical chests,
of great length in order that they might
contain, without folding, church vestments
stiff with embroidery, are the most
ornate of all the models of furniture
which have been preserved from the 13th
and 14th centuries. The article <span class='sc'>Chair</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 801) shows that chairs were
everywhere uncommon until the middle
of the 16th century; and it was not until
the 17th was well advanced that upholstery
began to be employed for them.
The typical Louis XVI chair, with its
oval back and ample seat, descending
arms, round-reeded legs and gay tapestry
was the most beautiful and elaborate
model that has ever been devised. But
it was the original Chippendale design
and the still lighter patterns of Hepplewhite,
Sheraton and Adam that gave us
the slender, compact and easily moved
chairs which will always be the more
numerous. It is interesting to observe
that the revolving chair, commonly regarded
as an office convenience of modern
origin, has a pedigree of no less than four
centuries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bookcases and Desks</div>

<p class='c007'>It would seem that the old English
makers of furniture went somewhat
astray when they gave themselves the
general designation, still surviving, of
“cabinet-makers”; for we learn from the
article <span class='sc'>Cabinet</span> (Vol. 4, p. 918) that the
elaborate cabinets which have come
down to us from the 16th, 17th and 18th
centuries are almost invariably of Italian,
Dutch and French origin, and it was in
other branches of work that the English
were most successful. <span class='sc'>The Cupboard</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 634) was
used to contain
books long before
the <span class='sc'>Bookcase</span> (Vol.
4, p. 221) had assumed a distinct form,
and in the earlier bookcases the volumes
were either placed on their sides, or, if
upright, were ranged with their backs
to the wall and their edges outwards.
Until printing had cheapened books, it
was not the custom to mark the title on
the back, and the band of leather which
closed the volume, like the strap on an
old-fashioned wallet, bore the inscription.
Sheraton’s satinwood bookcases
were among the most elegant of all his
pieces. The <span class='sc'>Desk</span> (Vol. 8, p. 95) about
the year 1750 had assumed the form
which is now described as a library table—a
flat top with a set of drawers on each
side of the writer’s knees, when its vogue
was interrupted by the invention of the
cylinder-top desk. At first the cover was
a solid piece of curved wood, but the
“tambour,” or series of slats mounted on
canvas proved more serviceable; and the
American roll-top desk is now exported
to all parts of the world. Other articles
dealing with individual pieces of furniture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>are <span class='sc'>Wardrobe</span> (Vol. 28, p. 323), <span class='sc'>Sideboard</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 38), <span class='sc'>Dresser</span> (Vol. 8,
p. 577), <span class='sc'>Cheffonier</span> (Vol. 6, p. 22),
<span class='sc'>Cradle</span> (Vol. 7, p. 360), <span class='sc'>Buffet</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 757), and <span class='sc'>Mirror</span> (Vol. 18, p. 575).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Technical Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>Of the more technical articles <span class='sc'>Timber</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 978) shows the comparative
advantages of all the varieties of wood
used for furniture;
and, as the list at
the end of this chapter
shows, there is a
separate article on each kind. <span class='sc'>Tool</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 14), by J. G. Horner, is of
great importance. It would fill 75 pages
of this Guide, and contains 79 illustrations.
The furniture maker will find in
it complete information about all the
hand tools and machine tools used in the
industry. <span class='sc'>Joinery</span> (Vol. 15, p. 476), by
James Bartlett, describes, with practical
diagrams, every variety of joint and dovetail.
Sound guidance for the workshop
will be found in <span class='sc'>Glue</span> (Vol. 12, p. 143),

<div class='sidenote'>Biographical Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>Although wood, ivory, precious stones,
bronze, silver and gold have been used
from antiquity for the decorations of
furniture, the modern
maker will be
more concerned with
<span class='sc'>Wood-Carving</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 791), illustrated, by F. A.
Crallan, author of <i>Gothic Wood-carving</i>.
In this article materials and methods are
described, and there is much information
as to the domestic use of wood-carving.
The article will be most valuable to manufacturers
and dealers who have to do
with church fittings. <span class='sc'>Gilding</span> (Vol. 12,
p. 13) and <span class='sc'>Carving and Gilding</span> (Vol. 5,
p. 438) impart knowledge of a practical
nature as to these processes. The art of
inlaying is described in <span class='sc'>Marquetry</span> (Vol.
17, p. 751) and <span class='sc'>Bombay Furniture</span> (Vol.
4, p. 185); see also <span class='sc'>Veneer</span> (Vol. 27, p.
982). Materials other than wood used
for inlaying are described, as, for example,
<span class='sc'>Pearl</span> (Vol. 21, p. 25) for pearl and
mother of pearl; <span class='sc'>Ivory</span> (Vol. 15, p. 92),
<span class='sc'>Lapis Lazuli</span> (Vol. 16, p. 199), <span class='sc'>Tortoiseshell</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 71), <span class='sc'>Brass</span> (Vol. 4, p.
433), etc. The mention of the last two
materials naturally
suggests the name of
<span class='sc'>Boulle</span> and the
Britannica’s biography
of that artist. Such biographies,
as anyone interested in the subject knows,
are most difficult to find, and they are included
in much detail in the new Britannica.
<span class='sc'>Boulle</span> (Vol. 4, p. 321) was the
most distinguished of modern cabinet-makers
before the middle of the 18th
century; and, beginning with that date,
both France and England produced a
number of men whose renown is scarcely
less than that of the great painters, sculptors,
architects or musicians of the
period. The Britannica’s accounts of
their lives, ideas and work will be of much
value and interest to those who make or
deal in furniture. For the French
schools we get the essential facts about,
for example, <span class='sc'>Oeben</span> (Vol. 20, p. 11), to
whom Louis XV’s famous desk owes its
general plan; <span class='sc'>Riesener</span> (Vol. 23, p. 324),
his more celebrated pupil, who completed
the desk; <span class='sc'>Röntgen, David</span> (Vol. 23, p.
693), the maker of “harlequin furniture,”
several of whose ingenious mechanical devices
are described; and <span class='sc'>Gouthière</span> (Vol.
12, p. 291), the metal-worker whose furniture
mounts are among the most noted
art products of the Louis XV and XVI
periods. <span class='sc'>Chippendale</span> (Vol. 6, p. 237),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>with whom arose the marvellously brilliant
school of English cabinet-makers,
is the subject of a biography describing
fully the characteristics of his designs;
and the history of this school is continued
under such headings as <span class='sc'>Hepplewhite</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 305), whose taste at its best
“was so fine and so full of distinction, so
simple, modest and sufficient that it
amounted to genius”; <span class='sc'>Adam, Robert</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 172), who left so deep and enduring
a mark upon English furniture,
and <span class='sc'>Sheraton</span> (Vol. 24, p. 841), “the
most remarkable man in the history of
English furniture,” whose extravagant
creations marked the end of the great
school. Many other biographies are included
in the list appended.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='c014'>FOR MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS OF LEATHER AND LEATHER GOODS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The purpose of the department
of the Guide in which this chapter
appears, addressed to persons
engaged in certain important occupations,
is not only to show them
how Britannica-reading will enlarge their
knowledge of some aspects and relations
of their business, but also to show
how Britannica-reading will help them to
realize the importance of <i>educating the
general public</i> in regard to that business.
This education of the public is not necessarily
confined to advertising, although
the best form of advertising that can be
used by anyone who sells a good article,
or an article that is good at its price, is
probably to tell the public what it really is
and how it is really made. In the direct
personal intercourse between salesman
and purchaser there is opportunity for
the imparting of information which, if it
possesses genuine interest, will be gladly
received and will stimulate trade. Mere
praise of an article is uninteresting and
unconvincing; while facts that explain
<i>why</i> that article is adapted to a particular
use, and <i>why</i> it is better than another
article sold at a lower price will always
receive attention.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>About Selling Leather Goods</div>

<p class='c007'>All this is especially true of leather
goods, for the public ignorance on the
subject of leather is abysmal. Nothing
is more universally
used, yet ninety-nine
out of a hundred
who use it not only
do not know what lies beneath the surface
of it, but do not know that there is
any difference in value between a natural
grain surface and a mechanically grained
false surface, and it is quite certain that
nearly all the men and women who walk
out of a store after buying skiver would
be nonplussed if they were asked whether
the upper or lower part of a split skin was
the best.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both the leather merchant and the
public would be delighted to hear some
of the curious things that the Britannica
tells about leather, which is, from any
point of view, one of the most interesting
of all commodities; although few of those
who use it, and perhaps as few of those
who deal in it, ever stop to think how
curious a relation there is between the
original nature of the material and the
qualities of the finished product. In
cattle and sheep, the hide is a garment
that covers every part of the body but
the feet. Adapted to our own use, its
most important service as a garment is
to cover our feet. It is so far a natural
product that no imitation of it possesses
any of its chief merits, and yet so far an
artificial product that when the hide has
been removed from an animal, it requires
treatment in order that it may not lose
the flexibility which makes it, for a
thousand purposes, more valuable than
wood or metal, and in order that it may
not decay.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What Skin Is</div>

<p class='c007'>Skin is waterproof because its surface
consists of scales, and although in most
quadrupeds, as in man, these scales are
so small as to be invisible,
they will so
resist the entrance of
any tan liquor or other preservative fluid
that they must be scraped away before
the skin can be treated. Under these
horny scales there is a layer of soft cells,
and under this a membrane which makes
the natural grain surface of leather.
Under this, again, lies the “true” skin, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>In the upper of these two,
the white fibres lie parallel with the grain.
In the lower, the white fibres, which are
here coarser, lie in bundles, bound together
by yellow fibres, so that this layer
is really a woven fabric. The spaces in
the weave are filled with a soft jelly, and
the fibres do not multiply among themselves,
as cells do, but are developed, as
they are needed, from this jelly. Tan
liquor has the peculiar property of converting
this jelly into a “leathery” substance,
which although it does not then
assume the shape of fibres, becomes
nearly as tough as the fibres themselves,
and thus makes leather more solid and
stronger than the original skin; and the
virtue of leather depends largely on the
presence of this jelly.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Naturally
Woven Fibres<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
two layers. The body of an
old bull will have absorbed it, just as fat
is absorbed in old
age, so that the
spaces in the weave
of the fibre are left
vacant, and (as the scaly outer surface of
the skin has been scraped away to admit
the tan liquor) any water with which the
hide comes into contact will be soaked up.
That is why old bull leather is not waterproof
and is lacking in substance. Again,
the weave of this innermost layer of skin,
lying next to the flesh, varies in different
animals. In sheepskin the fibres are very
loosely woven, and for this reason great
care is needed in preparing the leather,
and when the skin is split, the under half
is only fit for the light usage to which
“chamois” leather is restricted. But
however the quality, surface or thickness
of the skin may differ, its true structure
is the same in all animals used for leather,
save the horse, which is exceptional in
possessing, over the loins, a third skin,
very closely woven and very greasy,
which makes horsehide taken from this
part of the body peculiarly waterproof,
pliable and durable.</p>

<p class='c007'>As you are in the leather business, you
probably knew all these facts already, but
perhaps they were not arranged in your
mind in a form in which you could explain
them to others as clearly as you will
be able to do after reading the articles in
the Britannica from which this general
statement is summarized. And when you
are reading about any other business, or
about any other subject of any kind, you
will find that the Britannica <i>goes to the
root of the subject</i> in the same thorough
way in which it deals with the fibres and
the jelly that make up the substance of
leather. Now for the articles in detail—or
the principal ones; the others are
sufficiently indicated by the list at the
end of this chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Skin</span> (Vol. 25, p. 188), by Dr. F. G.
Parsons, vice-president of the Anatomical
Society of Great Britain and Ireland,
with illustrations from microscopic
enlargements, covers the comparative
anatomy of the skin in all groups of animals,
and the process of skin development
in the embryo. The articles mentioned
in the chapter <i>For Stock-Raisers</i> tell you
about the domestic animals whose hides
are chiefly used for leather. The chapter
on <i>Zoology</i> in this Guide gives a list of the
articles on the other animals whose skins
are tanned for fancy leathers. The main
article <span class='sc'>Leather</span> (Vol. 16, p. 330), equivalent
to 50 pages of this Guide, is by Dr.
James G. Parker, principal of the Leathersellers’
Technical College, London, and
author of <i>Principles of Tanning</i> and other
standard trade text-books. After explaining
the distinctions between tanned,
tawed, and chamoised leathers, it takes
up the subject of sources and qualities of
hides and skins, and describes the structure
of skin in relation to the finished
product. The characteristics and peculiarities
of hides and skins from different
parts of the world are thoroughly explained.
We learn why hides from animals
bred in mountainous districts are
the best, and where the finest sheep- and
goat-skins come from.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Processes of Tanning</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Tanning Materials</i> is the subject of the
next section. These are classified into
pyrogallols, catechols, and subsidiary materials;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and the article describes their
composition and preparation by grinding,
with explicit directions for their
testing, including the
latest official method
of the International Association of
Leather Trades Chemists. The processes
of making heavy leathers are next discussed.
We learn the many ways of
cleaning, softening, depilating, and fellmongering
(or dewooling) by liming,
rounding and scudding, and finally the
process of actual tanning in its three steps
of colouring, handling, and laying away.
In connection with depilation, it is interesting
to note that it has been discovered
that it is not the lime but the action of
bacteria in the lime which causes the hair
to fall out. The finishing of sole leather,
harness leather and other grades is explained,
also the theory of the formation
of the “bloom” and its removal, as well
as the process of “scouring.” The art of
<i>Currying</i> has a section to itself, and the
preparations for tanning or dressing
hides for trunks and suit cases by bating,
puering, scudding, plumping, drenching
and splitting, receive detailed attention.
The tanning of light leathers, and all the
varieties of basils, skivers, Russia leather,
seal, alligator, snake, frog and kangaroo
leathers, Japan and enamel leathers are
fully treated. <i>Tawing</i>, <i>Wooling</i>, <i>Dressing</i>,
<i>Chrome Tanning</i>, <i>Combination Tannages</i>,
<i>Oil Tanning</i> (Chamoising), <i>Preller’s Helvetia</i>
or <i>Crown Leather</i>, <i>Transparent
Leather</i>, <i>Parchment</i>, <i>Tar and Peat Tanning</i>,
<i>Dyeing</i>, <i>Staining</i> and <i>Finishing</i>,
<i>Glove Leathers</i>, and <i>Bookbinding Leathers</i>
are some of the other sections of this excellent
treatise. <span class='sc'>Leather, Artificial</span>

<div class='sidenote'>Chemistry of Leather Manufacture</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tannin</span>, or <span class='sc'>Tannic Acid</span> (Vol. 26, p.
399) is a general account of the vegetable
products which have the property of converting
raw hide into leather. Specific information

the pleasant odor is due.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are numerous articles in the
Britannica on the chemicals used in the
process of tawing, chrome tanning, etc.,
such as <span class='sc'>Alum</span> (Vol. 1, p. 766), <span class='sc'>Acetic
Acid</span> (Vol. 1, p. 135), <span class='sc'>Glauber’s Salt</span>
(Vol. 12, p. 114), <span class='sc'>Bichromates and
Chromates</span> (Vol. 3, p. 912).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dyeing</div>

<p class='c007'>The chief classes of dyes used for
leather are the acid; basic, or tannic;
direct, or cotton; and mordant dyes, and
these are described at great
length in a valuable article
<span class='sc'>Dyeing</span> (Vol. 8, p. 744),
equivalent to 20 pages of this Guide, by
the late J. J. Hummel, professor of Dyeing,
University of Leeds, and Dr. Edmund
Knecht, professor of Technological
Chemistry, University of Manchester.
The section on the <i>Theory of Dyeing</i> shows
how the dyeing property of a substance
depends upon its chemical composition.
Separate articles go more deeply into the
chemistry of dyeing materials used with
leather, and some of the more important
of these are <span class='sc'>Sulphonic Acids</span> (Vol. 26, p.
60), <span class='sc'>Sulphuric Acid</span> (Vol. 26, p. 65),
<span class='sc'>Formic Acid</span> (Vol. 10, p. 668), <span class='sc'>Antimony</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 127), <span class='sc'>Titanium</span> (Vol.
26, p. 1017), <span class='sc'>Iron</span> (Vol. 14, p. 796), <span class='sc'>Logwood</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 922), <span class='sc'>Fustic</span> (Vol. 11,

<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and <span class='sc'>Tumeric</span> (Vol. 27, p. 474). Comparatively
few of the coal-tar colours
have as yet been adapted to leather manufacture,
but their characteristics are discussed
in such articles as <span class='sc'>Azo-Compounds</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 81), <span class='sc'>Aniline</span> (Vol. 2, p. 47),
<span class='sc'>Indulines</span> (Vol. 14, p. 507), <span class='sc'>Fuchsine</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 273), and <span class='sc'>Safranine</span> (Vol.
23, p. 1000).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Special Leathers</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Parchment</span> (Vol. 20, p. 798), by Sir E.
Maunde Thompson, Principal Librarian,
British Museum, is an interesting historical
account of the skins and their preparation.
Their use as writing material
was widespread at a very early period.
“The Jews made use of them,” says the
article “for their sacred books, and it may
be presumed for other literature also; and
the old tradition
has been maintained
down to our own
day, requiring the
Synagogue rolls to be inscribed on this
time-honoured material.” The difference
between parchment and vellum is explained.
<span class='sc'>Shagreen</span> (Vol. 24, p. 769)
tells about a species of untanned leather
used for ornamental purposes. It is a
curious fact that the addition of the word
“chagrin,” for anxiety or annoyance, to
the English language was due to the unpleasant
sensation that came from touching
the rasping surface of this leather.
Stamped leather for wall hangings is described
in the section <i>Stamped Leather</i> of
the article <span class='sc'>Mural Decoration</span> (Vol. 19,
p. 19), by William Morris and Walter
Crane. <span class='sc'>Shoe</span> (Vol. 24, p. 992) contains
an illustrated section on the <i>Manufacture
of Leather Shoes</i>. <span class='sc'>Saddlery and Harness</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 988), by Cecil Weatherly,
and <span class='sc'>Glove</span> (Vol. 12, p. 135) are
treated both from an historical and a
practical point of view. <span class='sc'>Bookbinding</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 216), illustrated, by C. J. H.
Davenport, of the British Museum, has
a great deal of interesting information
about the leathers used in this art. The
flexible binding, which has been applied
for the first time on a large scale in the
new Britannica, originated when vellum
instead of paper was used for books, and
it possesses the great advantage that
a volume sewed in this way can be
opened flat, and lies flat without being
held.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='c014'>FOR JEWELLERS, CLOCK AND WATCH MAKERS AND MERCHANTS</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>By long established custom, watches
and the higher grade of clocks form
part of the jeweller’s stock, and he
sells a few other articles of utility, such as
purses and bags, but to all intents and
purposes he shares with the artist and
art-dealer the distinction of making a
living by adding pleasure to the lives of
others. The very word “jewelry” carries,
in its root form, the idea of joy; and
when a Senwosri princess, 43 centuries
ago, smiled happily as she raised her
brown arms to fasten the clasp of a new
necklace, the jeweller of Memphis on the
Nile no doubt took his little profit, as the
jeweller of Memphis on the Mississippi
takes his to-day, all the more gladly for
being, in the oriental phrase, a “Distributor
of delights.” Sour philosophers
have always sneered at women for loving
jewels, and most of all for piercing their
ears and noses to vary its display, but
the nose-ring that overhangs a thick
Nubian lip is an expression of the same
charming instinct that makes a child
diversify the arrangement of her daisychains.
And jewelry plays its part in the
higher emotions as well as in the pretty
vanities; witness the engagement ring,
the marriage ring and all the uses, described
in the Britannica, of jewels as
religious symbols.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Specimens Reproduced</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Jewelry</span> (Vol. 15, p. 364),
by A. H. Smith, the official in charge of
the great jewel collection in the British
Museum, contains
nearly a hundred illustrations,
half of
them on plate paper,
which include examples of every period
and every variety of the jeweller’s art,
and these, with the illustrations in other
articles mentioned in this chapter, are so
full of interest to the jeweller’s customers
that he ought really to keep his Britannica
at his place of business rather than
at his house. It is, at any rate, amusing
to recall that in a speech made by the
Editor-in-chief of the Britannica, on the
occasion of a banquet given to celebrate
the completion of the new edition, he remarked
that when he had chanced to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>take home the proof sheets of this article,
to read them at night, he carefully kept
them out of his wife’s sight lest they
might suggest too tempting possibilities.
The article divides modern jewelry into
three classes:</p>

<p class='c020'><i>(1) objects in which gems and stones
form the principal portions, and in which
the work in silver, platinum or gold is really
only a means for carrying out the design
by fixing the gems or stones in the position
arranged by the designer, the metal employed
being visible only as a setting</i>;</p>

<p class='c020'><i>(2) when gold work plays an important
part in the development of the design, being
itself ornamented by engraving (now rarely
used) or enamelling or both, the stones and
gems being arranged in subordination to the
gold work in such positions as to give a decorative
effect to the whole</i>;</p>

<p class='c020'><i>(3) when gold or other metal is alone
used, the design being wrought out by hammering
in repoussé, casting, engraving,
chasing or by the addition of filigree work,
or when the surfaces are left absolutely
plain but polished and highly finished</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The “Personal Art” Movement</div>

<p class='c007'>The second of these three classes includes
the work which has completely
revolutionized the theory of design, so
far as the best class of trade is concerned,
since the Paris International Exposition
of 1900 first drew general attention to the
exquisite creations of Lalique and his
school. L. C. Tiffany, in the United
States, and Philippe
Wolfers, in Belgium,
have done more than
any designers other
than the French to extend this new movement;
but in England, Germany, Austria,
Russia and Switzerland there has been a
notable increase of individual effort and
purpose, and a recognition of the possibilities
of personal art as at any rate an
important factor in the business. Side
by side with this development new standards
have been established in mechanical
work. “Nearly every kind of gold chain
now made is manufactured by machinery,
and nothing like the beauty of design or
perfection of workmanship could be obtained
by hand at, probably, any cost.”
The article, equivalent in length to about
35 pages of this Guide, contains a full
review, amplified by the results of the
most recent excavations (some of them
undertaken expressly for the archaeological
purposes of this edition of the Britannica)
of the history of jewelry, Egyptian,
Assyrian, Mycenean, Greek, Etruscan,
Roman, Merovingian, Oriental and
Renaissance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rings for Love and Murder</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Ring</span> (Vol. 23, p. 349), of which Prof.
Middleton, long art director of the South
Kensington Museum, is the chief contributor,
is another copiously illustrated
article. Among the curious items of information
it contains, there is the unromantic
origin of the engagement ring
(which may be cited by the jeweller to
prove that it should always be a costly
one), the ancient Romans regarding it as
a pledge to assure the donor’s fulfilment
of his promise; the fact that the modern
rheumatism ring had its medieval forerunner
in the rings, blessed by the sovereign,
which were worn as a preservative
against cramp; and the description of the
old poison rings, which were of two kinds:
those merely affording, in the bezel, a
secret receptacle so that the poison might
be always at hand
for suicide, and those
provided with a hollow
point to which,
on touching a spring, the venom ran as
in a snake’s fang, so that the murderer
could give a fatal scratch while shaking
hands with his victim. <span class='sc'>Brooch</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 641) traces, with many illustrations of
typical specimens, the “fibula” or safety
pin from its origin in Central Europe
during the Bronze Age, through the
modifications which introduced the bow
shape, providing space for thicker folds
of cloth, to the modern ornament. The
long brooch is not a new fashion, for silver
brooches no less than 15 inches in length
have been found in Viking hoards of the
7th, 8th and 9th centuries. <span class='sc'>Ear-ring</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 798) describes ear “ornaments”
of the most grotesque size. In
Borneo the hole in the ear lobe is stretched
to a calibre of 3¾ inches, but the Masai
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>tribes in equatorial Africa far outdo this,
stretching the lobes, year after year, until
they can wear stone ear-plugs weighing
2 lbs. 14 ozs. each, with a diameter of 4½
inches; and they thus achieve the supreme
elegance of making the two long
flaps of flesh meet above their heads. It
is also curious to note the custom of
some oriental tribes of wearing one ear-ring
only. <span class='sc'>Bracelet</span> (Vol. 4, p. 359) describes
the three distinct models worn by
the Israelites, all of which the Authorized
Version calls “bracelet,” although the
original Hebrew has separate names for
them. Armlets have always been conspicuous
in the regalia of Eastern kings,
and the pair captured at Delhi and taken
to Persia by Nadir Shah in 1739 contain
jewels valued at more than $5,000,000,
including the famous “Sea of Light”
diamond, which, although it weighs only
186 carats as against the 516½ of the
largest fraction into which the Cullinan
stone was cut, is unique as possessing the
finest lustre of any known specimen. The
24 plate illustrations in the article <span class='sc'>Scandinavian
Civilization</span> (Vol. 24, p. 287),
by Miss B. S. Phillpotts, show some exquisite
designs of clasps, collars and pins
exhumed in Denmark, Norway and Sweden,
and supposed by some authorities to
antedate the oldest Egyptian jewelry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Precious Metals</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Gold</span> (Vol. 12, p. 192) is a
thorough workshop treatise, as well as a
detailed study of existing mines and of
the influence their
production exerts
upon the “price,” if
it can be so called,
of a metal which is its own standard of
value. <span class='sc'>Silver</span> (Vol. 25, p. 112) and
<span class='sc'>Platinum</span> (Vol. 21, p. 805) are treated
with similar comprehensiveness. The
articles <span class='sc'>Alloys</span> (Vol. 1, p. 704), <span class='sc'>Assaying</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 776), <span class='sc'>Metal</span> (Vol. 18, p.
198), <span class='sc'>Metallography</span> (Vol. 18, p. 202),
and <span class='sc'>Metallurgy</span> (Vol. 18, p. 203), all by
noted authorities, are full of information
useful to the jeweller. <span class='sc'>Metal-Work</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 205), fully illustrated, incidentally
touches upon the art of the
silver- and gold-smith; and this branch of
the subject is also treated in such articles
as <span class='sc'>Plate</span> (Vol. 21, p. 789), with
over 30 typical illustrations—a most interesting
historical account, by several
well-known experts, of works in gold and
silver which belong to any class other
than those of personal ornament and
coins; and <span class='sc'>Drinking Vessels</span> (Vol. 8, p.
580), illustrated, by Dr. Charles H. Read
of the British Museum, which discusses
gold and silver cups. Mention must also
be made of the description of American
work in precious metals before the time
of Christopher Columbus, in the section
<i>Archaeology</i> of the article <span class='sc'>America</span> (Vol.
1, p. 812), by the late Dr. O. T. Mason,
of the National Museum, Washington;
also of <span class='sc'>Mexico</span>, <i>Ancient Civilization</i>
(Vol. 18, p. 335), by the famous ethnologists,
Dr. E. B. Tylor of Oxford and Dr.
Walter Lehmann, of the Royal Ethnographical
Museum, Munich; <span class='sc'>Egypt</span>, <i>Ancient
Art</i> (Vol. 9, p. 73), by W. M. Flinders
Petrie; <span class='sc'>Greek Art</span> (Vol. 12, p. 470),
illustrated, by Dr. Percy Gardner, of Oxford;
<span class='sc'>Roman Art</span>, <i>Work in Precious

H. Stuart Jones, director of the British
School at Rome; <span class='sc'>Japan</span>, <i>Art, Sculpture

Frank Brinkley, author of <i>A History of the
Japanese People</i>; and <span class='sc'>China</span>, <i>Bronzes</i>
(Vol. 6, p. 215), by C. J. Holmes, formerly
Slade professor of fine art at Oxford.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Filigree</span> (Vol. 10, p. 343) describes
the delicate jewel work of twisted gold
and silver threads, and also the “granulated”
work which consists of minute
globules of gold soldered to form patterns
on a metal surface. In India the filigree
worker has retained the patterns used by
the ancient Greeks and works in the
same way they did. Wandering workmen
are given so much gold, coined or
rough. This is weighed, heated and
beaten into wire, and worked in the
courtyard or on the verandah of the customer’s
house. The worker reweighs the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>complete work when finished and is paid
at a specified rate for his labor. Repoussé
(Vol. 23, p. 108), by M. H. Spielmann,
editor <i>Magazine of Art</i>; <span class='sc'>Chasing</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 956) and <span class='sc'>Inlaying</span> (Vol. 14,
p. 574) are other articles dealing with certain
processes in jewel work. The jeweller
also must not overlook two superb articles,
<span class='sc'>Medal</span> (Vol. 18, p. 1), illustrated,
by M. H. Spielmann, and <span class='sc'>Numismatics</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 869), which is by three specialists,
and is most fully illustrated by
designs inviting practical use. <span class='sc'>Enamel</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 362), illustrated, by Alexander
Fisher, author of <i>The Art of Enamelling on
Metals</i>, goes very fully and practically
into this interesting subject, which is
further discussed in <span class='sc'>Japan</span>, <i>Cloisonné
Enamel</i> (Vol. 15, p. 189). <span class='sc'>Mosaic</span> (Vol.
18, p. 883), illustrated, by Professor Middleton
and H. Stuart Jones, deals in part
with the ornamentation of jewelry by
this method. In <span class='sc'>Brazing</span> and <span class='sc'>Soldering</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 463) the composition of
silver solder used for jewelry is described,
and in <span class='sc'>Cement</span> there is an account of
<i>Jeweller’s</i> or <i>Armenian Cement</i> (Vol. 5,
p. 659).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Precious Stones</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Gem</span> treats the subject in
two sections, of which the first (Vol. 11,
p. 560), by F. W. Rudler, of the Museum
of Practical Geology,
London, deals with
<i>Mineralogy</i> and <i>General
Properties</i>. Here
are discussed hardness, specific gravity,
crystaline forms and cleavage, colour, refraction,
chemical composition, etc., and
there is an interesting section on superstitions
in regard to gems, the medical
and magical powers with which they
were reputed to be endowed. These beliefs
are very remarkable, and it has even
been suggested by archaeologists that jewelry
did not have its origin so much in a
love for personal decoration, as in the
belief that the objects used possessed
magical virtue. The article <span class='sc'>Mineralogy</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 509), by L. J. Spencer, of the
British Museum, and editor of the <i>Mineralogical
Magazine</i>, will be found especially
valuable for reference in the
workshop. It gives, among other things,
the scale of hardness, and nomenclature
and classification of minerals. The crystal
formation of gems as well as their optical
properties—characteristics by which
the genuineness of precious stones may
be tested—are discussed and explained
in the article <span class='sc'>Crystallography</span> (Vol. 7,
p. 569), with over 100 illustrations, also
by L. J. Spencer. The cutting of gem
stones is treated under <span class='sc'>Lapidary and
Gem Cutting</span> (Vol. 16, p. 195), by Dr.
George F. Kunz, the famous gem expert
to Tiffany &#38; Co., New York,—an article
of uncommon historical interest and
practical value, in which diamond cutting
is considered at much length.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second section of the article <span class='sc'>Gem</span>,
<i>Gems in Art</i> (Vol. 11, p. 562), by Dr. A. S.
Murray, the famous British archaeologist,
and A. H. Smith, gives an account of
precious stones engraved with designs.
The illustrations show more than 90 examples,
including Cretan and Mycenaean
intaglios, Greek, Phœnician and Etruscan
scarabs and scarabæoids, cameos, seals,
Oriental, Christian, and modern gems.
This subject is further discussed in separate
articles, such as <span class='sc'>Scarab</span> (Vol. 24, p.
301), by Dr. F. Ll. Griffith, the Egyptologist,
an account of the designs which,
originating in Egypt during the Fourth
Dynasty, have exercised a lasting influence
on the design and shape of gems;
<span class='sc'>Cameo</span> (Vol. 5, p. 104), <span class='sc'>Intaglio</span> (Vol.
14, p. 680), <span class='sc'>Seals</span> (Vol. 24, p. 539), illustrated,
by Sir E. Maunde Thompson,
formerly principal librarian, British Museum,
as well as in the articles on ancient
and Oriental civilizations, already mentioned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Synthetic Stones</div>

<p class='c007'>The artificial duplication of certain
gems by chemical processes which yield
products identical in
composition and
physical properties
with the natural
stones is a subject of growing importance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>to the jeweller, and the latest developments
are described in <span class='sc'>Gem, Artificial</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 569), by Sir William
Crookes. This famous chemist and authority
on precious stones does not hesitate
to declare that although the artificial
diamonds so far produced have been
microscopic in size, scientists have now
found the right method and that “there
is no reason to doubt that, working on a
larger scale, larger diamonds will result.”
The artificial production of rubies, sapphires,
Oriental emeralds, amethysts, topazes
and zircons is also discussed. Descriptions
of the several gem stones are
found under their respective headings, for
example <span class='sc'>Diamond</span> (Vol. 8, p. 158), illustrated,
by H. A. Miers, principal of the
University of London, and former editor
of the <i>Mineralogical Magazine</i>. Here are
given its scientific characters, its uses
(especially for faceting softer precious
stones), distribution, and mining, and the
wonderful history of the most famous
diamonds of the world. <span class='sc'>Ruby</span> (Vol. 23,
p. 812), the most valued of gem stones,
is often called “Oriental ruby” to distinguish
it from <span class='sc'>Spinel</span> (Vol. 25, p. 684),
an aluminate stone of inferior hardness,
density and value. It is interesting to
note that many historic stones described
as monster rubies were really spinels.
The great ruby set in the Maltese Cross
in front of the Imperial State Crown of
England is a spinel. <span class='sc'>Sapphire</span> (Vol. 24,
p. 201) was known to the Greeks as “hyacinthus,”
and the present name was formerly
applied to lapis lazuli. <span class='sc'>Asteria</span> or
<span class='sc'>Star Stone</span> (Vol. 2, p. 792) tells how the
luminous star comes to be seen in sapphires,
rubies and topazes. The name
<span class='sc'>Emerald</span> (Vol. 9, p. 332) is used for a
number of stones, of which the most
valued is not a true emerald at all; see
<span class='sc'>Corundum</span> (Vol. 7, p. 207). The same is
true of the <span class='sc'>Topaz</span> (Vol. 27, p. 48), the
more prized Oriental topaz being a yellow
corundum, harder and denser than the
stone from which it takes its name.
“Scotch” or “Spanish” topazes are yellow
or smoke-tinted quartz, or cairngorm.
The <span class='sc'>Amethyst</span> (Vol. 1, p. 852) is
violet or purple quartz, and the sapphire
of a purple colour is often called an
Oriental amethyst. The many varieties
of the beautiful <span class='sc'>Zircon</span> (Vol. 28, p. 989),
such as <span class='sc'>Hyacinth</span> (Vol. 14, p. 25) and
<span class='sc'>Jargoon</span> (Vol. 15, p. 276) are carefully
described and distinguished. These valuable
articles on the precious stones have
been contributed by F. W. Rudler, of the
Museum of Practical Geology, London.
<span class='sc'>Pearl</span> (Vol. 21, p. 24) discusses the results
of the latest researches on the cause
of pearl formation, and gives a graphic
account of pearl-fishing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Semi-Precious Stones</div>

<p class='c007'>The material in the Britannica on the
semi-precious stones is as complete.
There are many articles, specified in the
list at the end of
this chapter. <span class='sc'>Alexandrite</span>
(Vol. 1, p.
576) is remarkable
for its property of appearing dark green
by daylight, and red by candle-light,
which makes it especially popular in
Russia where green and red are the military
colors; <span class='sc'>Chrysoberyl</span> (Vol. 6, p.
320), of which alexandrite is a variety;
<span class='sc'>Chrysolite</span> (Vol. 6, p, 320), often mistaken
for chrysoberyl; <span class='sc'>Peridot</span> (Vol. 21,
p. 147), like chrysolite, a variety of olivine;
<span class='sc'>Beryl</span> (Vol. 3, p. 817), much prized
by the ancients as a gem stone, and of
which the <span class='sc'>Emerald</span> (see above) and the
<span class='sc'>Aquamarine</span> (Vol. 2, p. 237) are the
chief “precious” varieties; <span class='sc'>Tourmaline</span>
(Vol. 27, p 103), the remarkable stone of
as much interest to the physicist as to the
jeweller, on account of its optical and
electrical properties; and <span class='sc'>Rubellite</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 804), its much prized red
variety <span class='sc'>Garnet</span> (Vol. 11, p. 470), together
with <span class='sc'>Almandine</span> (Vol. 1, p. 712),
which, when cut with a convex face is
known as carbuncle; <span class='sc'>Cinnamon-Stone</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 376), the light red garnet, so
easily mistaken for a variety of zircon
(the article tells how to distinguish them);
<span class='sc'>Demantoid</span> (Vol. 7, p. 979), the green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>garnet from the Urals, and <span class='sc'>Pyrope</span> (Vol.
22, p. 695), usually known as Bohemian
garnet; <span class='sc'>Jade</span> (Vol. 15, p. 122), which occupies
in China the highest place as a
jewel, and whose many varieties are here
clearly distinguished; <span class='sc'>Jet</span> (Vol. 15, p.
358); <span class='sc'>Haematite</span> (Vol. 12, p. 804); <span class='sc'>Moonstone</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 807); <span class='sc'>Cat’s-Eye</span> (Vol.
5, p. 537), a term applied to several distinct
minerals of which <span class='sc'>Crocidolite</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 477) has recently become very
popular; <span class='sc'>Opal</span> (Vol. 20, p. 120), an article
in which the brilliant flashes of
colour in this stone are explained; <span class='sc'>Quartz</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 715), with its many ornamental
varieties such as <span class='sc'>Agate</span> (Vol. 1,
p. 368), <span class='sc'>Amethyst</span> (Vol. 1, p. 852),
<span class='sc'>Aventurine</span> (Vol. 3, p. 54), <span class='sc'>Bloodstone</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 85), <span class='sc'>Cairngorm</span> (Vol.
4, p. 952), <span class='sc'>Carnelian</span> (Vol. 5, p. 365),
<span class='sc'>Chalcedony</span> (Vol. 5, p. 803), <span class='sc'>Chrysoprase</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 320), <span class='sc'>Heliotrope</span> (Vol.
13, p. 232), <span class='sc'>Mocha Stone</span> (Vol. 18, p.
637), <span class='sc'>Onyx</span> (Vol. 20, p. 118), <span class='sc'>Rock-Crystal</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 433), <span class='sc'>Sard</span> (Vol. 24,
p. 209), and <span class='sc'>Sardonyx</span> (Vol. 24, p. 2.18).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Watches and Clocks</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Watch</span> (Vol. 28, p. 362),
illustrated, by Lord Grimthorpe, the
great authority on watches and clocks,
and Sir H. H. Cunynghame,
vice-president
of the British
Institute of Electrical
Engineers, is full of interest. There
is a very valuable historical account
beginning with the invention of portable
time pieces in the 15th century. The
parts of a modern watch are described,
with details as to the mainspring, different
types of escapement, the balance-wheel
and hair-spring, compensation adjustments
and secondary compensation.
Methods of correcting temperature errors
are discussed, and a simple means for
demagnetizing a watch which has been
near a dynamo is given. The proper materials
used for jewelled bearings are described
in the articles <span class='sc'>Diamond</span>, <span class='sc'>Corundum</span>,
etc. <span class='sc'>Lubricants</span> (Vol. 17, p. 88)
contains a valuable paragraph on the
properties and preparation of the fluid
oils used on the spindles of watches and
clocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Clock</span> (Vol. 6, p. 536) is by
the same distinguished authorities as
<span class='sc'>Watch</span>, with an additional section on
<i>Decorative Aspects</i> (p. 552), by James
Penderel-Brodhurst. It is equivalent to
55 pages of this Guide and is fully illustrated.
Among the topics considered are
the earliest clocks and their gradual improvement;
the essential components of
a clock; the mechanics of the pendulum;
methods of compensation, including the
use of the new nickel-steel alloy—described
in the article <span class='sc'>Invar</span> (Vol. 14, p.
717)—the barometrical error, and methods
of counteraction; suspension of pendulums;
balance, anchor, dead, pinwheel,
detached or free, and gravity escapements;
the remontoire systems for
abolishing errors in the force driving the
escapement; testing of clocks; clock
wheels; striking mechanism; the watchman’s
clock, church and turret clocks,
electrical clocks, miscellaneous clocks, including
magical clocks and other curious
designs. The section on <i>Decorative Aspects</i>
tells about styles of cases and
mountings, the origin and development
of the “grandfather” clock, etc. In connection
with long-period clocks, attention
should be given to the new and ingenious,
if not commercially practical, device invented
by the Hon. R. J. Strutt. Electrified
particles emitted by a radioactive
substance separate two strips of gold leaf,
and these, falling together after the
charge has been conducted away upon
contact with metal, are extended again,
the process being constantly repeated.
If some way could be found to utilize this
motion to work an escapement, we
should have a clock that would go on indefinitely,
since 1000 years must elapse
before even half the small amount of
radium used has disappeared. A description
of this so-called “radium” clock
will be found in <span class='sc'>Perpetual Motion</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 181).</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI<br> <span class='c014'>FOR MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS OF ELECTRICAL MACHINERY AND SUPPLIES</span></h3>
</div>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Construction and Operation</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>Electrical machinery and supplies
include three main groups of
appliances: The apparatus by which
electricity is originally generated; the apparatus
by which current is transmitted
and, if necessary, modified before it is
used; and the infinitely various appliances
for its final employment. In connection
with any one of the latter, information
may be needed as to its structure
and its mechanical or electrochemical
method of operation, or as to its
uses, and in the treatment of these two
aspects of a vast number of subjects the
advantages of the encyclopaedic plan of
the Britannica are obvious. One article
will explain the method by which the
same principles are applied to a number
of different machines. Another article
will deal with a group of appliances all
used for similar purposes; and a reference
to the Index of 500,000
entries (Vol. 29)
will at once guide
the reader who turns
to the name of any electrical appliance to
either kind of information he desires at
the moment, whether he wants to know
how the machine is made and operated,
or what kind of work it does and how
efficiently it does it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader to whom this chapter is addressed
is already familiar with the general
subject of electricity, but he may at
any moment desire to review or to supplement
his general knowledge in connection
with some new appliance which,
for the first time, applies to commercial
use one of the many and intricate laws
of electrical vibration. The whole subject
of the nature and action of electricity
is outlined in the article <span class='sc'>Electricity</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 179), by Prof. J. A. Fleming,
of the University of London, one of the
world’s foremost authorities. In a space
equivalent to hardly more than 30 pages
of this Guide, the field covered in detail
by many other articles is so concisely and
clearly surveyed that you get a complete
view of the theoretical and practical developments
by which electrical science
and industry have reached their present
position. The same contributor then
considers <span class='sc'>Electrostatics</span> (Vol. 9, p. 240)
and <span class='sc'>Electrokinetics</span> (Vol. 9, p. 210);
and, in <span class='sc'>Conduction, Electric</span> (Vol. 6,
p. 855), deals with metallic, non-metallic,
dielectric and gaseous conductors. One
section of this article is by Sir J. J. Thomson,
winner, in 1906, of the Nobel Prize
for Physics. The form in which metal is
chiefly employed for the conduction of
electricity is the subject of a separate
article, <span class='sc'>Wire</span> (Vol. 28, p. 738); and the
articles on the individual metals deal with
their electrical properties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Batteries and Dynamos</div>

<p class='c007'>The whole subject of the chemical production
of electricity is discussed in
<span class='sc'>Electrolysis</span> (Vol. 9, p. 217), by W. C.
D. Whetham, of the
technical staff of
Cambridge University.
<span class='sc'>Battery</span> (Vol.
3, p. 531), fully illustrated, deals with all
the forms of primary battery, and <span class='sc'>Accumulator</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 126), also illustrated,
by Walter Hibbert, of the London Polytechnic,
with all the secondary types.
The alkaline accumulators, of which the
Edison apparatus is a well known type,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>are the subject of a special section. Turning
to mechanically produced electricity,
the first article to read is <span class='sc'>Electromagnetism</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 226). This brings you
naturally to the article <span class='sc'>Dynamo</span> (Vol. 8,
p. 764), by C. C. Hawkins, author of one
of the best practical text-books on the
subject. This copiously illustrated article,
in length equivalent to 50 pages of
this Guide, discusses <i>continuous current
dynamos</i>, <i>lap-winding</i>, <i>commutators</i>, <i>field-magnets</i>,
<i>forgings and castings for magnets</i>,
<i>air-gaps</i>, <i>armature cores</i>, <i>carbon brushes</i>,
<i>cooling surfaces</i> and <i>alternators</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus covered the subject of obtaining
current, the group of articles next
to be considered is that dealing with its
measurement and the examination of resistances.
The general article <span class='sc'>Units,
Physical</span> (Vol. 27, p. 740), contains a
section on <i>electrical units</i>. Then come
<span class='sc'>Potentiometer</span> (Vol. 22, p. 205); <span class='sc'>Meter,
Electric</span> (Vol. 18, p. 291); <span class='sc'>Voltmeter</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 206), illustrated;
<span class='sc'>Amperemeter</span> (Vol. 1, p. 879), illustrated;
<span class='sc'>Ohmmeter</span> (Vol. 20, p. 34);
<span class='sc'>Wattmeter</span> (Vol. 28, p. 419); <span class='sc'>Galvanometer</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 428), illustrated;
<span class='sc'>Electrometer</span> (Vol. 9, p. 234), illustrated;
<span class='sc'>Electroscope</span> (Vol. 9, p. 239),
illustrated; <span class='sc'>Wheatstone’s Bridge</span> (Vol.
28, p. 584), illustrated; and <span class='sc'>Oscillograph</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 347), illustrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lighting Appliances</div>

<p class='c007'>The commercial supply of current is
covered by a series of articles of which
the first to be read is <span class='sc'>Electricity Supply</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 193), to which Emile
Garcke, the famous electrical engineer,
contributes a section. <span class='sc'>Power Transmission</span>,
<i>Electrical</i> (Vol. 22, p. 233), is by
Louis Bell, chief engineer of the General
Electric Co., Boston; and contains full
details as to the use of both two-phase
and three-phase generators in transmission.
<span class='sc'>Induction
Coil</span> (Vol. 14, p.
502) and <span class='sc'>Transformers</span>
(Vol. 27, p.
173) are both fully illustrated. <span class='sc'>Lighting</span>,
<i>Electric</i> (Vol. 16, p. 659) deals with arc, incandescent
and vapour lamps, and with
wiring. The section on household work
gives excellent practical information
about the best arrangements of lights. A
special class of electric light supplies is
discussed in <span class='sc'>Lighthouse</span> (Vol. 16, p.
627), by W. T. Douglass, who erected the
new Eddystone and the Bishop’s Rock
lights, and by N. G. Gedye, another
practical expert.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appliances used to convert current
back again into the mechanical
energy from which it had been derived are
described in the article <span class='sc'>Motors, Electric</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 910). This article divides
continuous current motors into five
classes: <i>Separately excited</i>; <i>series-wound
constant current</i>; <i>series-wound constant potential</i>;
<i>series-wound interdependent current
and potential</i>; and <i>shunt-wound constant
potential</i>. Alternating current motors
are similarly classified as <i>Synchronous
constant potential</i>; <i>induction-polyphase
constant potential</i>; <i>induction monophase
constant potential</i>; <i>repulsion commutating</i>,
and <i>series-commutating</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Trolley Cars and Railroads</div>

<p class='c007'>Machinery for applying electric power
to transportation, both for trolley cars
and heavy railroad traffic, is described
in the article
<span class='sc'>Traction</span> (Vol. 27,
p. 118), by Prof.
Louis Duncan, who
designed the first electric locomotives
employed with large loads—those introduced
in 1895 by the Baltimore &#38; Ohio
R.R. for its track in the tunnel under
Baltimore. The article gives, with many
mechanical diagrams, accounts of the appliances
by which the current is taken
from trolley wires, conduits and third
rails, and of the types of motors and controllers
employed. <span class='sc'>Crane</span> (Vol. 7, p.
368), by Walter Pitt, describes the peculiar
type of “crane-rated” motor, by the
aid of which steam and hydraulic cranes
can be displaced. The electric furnaces
used for the reduction of ores and for
manufacturing processes in which exceptionally
high temperatures are required,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>are treated in <span class='sc'>Electrometallurgy</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 232), by W. G. M’Millan,
lecturer on metallurgy at Mason
College, Birmingham. Electric machinery
for the refining of metals is dealt with
in the article <span class='sc'>Electrochemistry</span> (Vol. 9,
p. 208). Under <span class='sc'>Surgical Instruments</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 133) there is a description of
the apparatus used for cautery and for
illuminating parts of the interior of the
body. The appliances used in <span class='sc'>Electrotherapeutics</span>
are dealt with under that
heading (Vol. 9, p. 249). Information as
to other medical and surgical apparatus
will be found under <span class='sc'>Röntgen Rays</span> (Vol.
23, p. 694), <span class='sc'>X-Ray Treatment</span> (Vol. 28,
p. 887), by Dr. H. L. Jones, of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, London; and <span class='sc'>Fluorescence</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 575), by Prof. J.
R. Cotter, of Trinity College, Dublin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Telegraph and Telephone</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Telegraph</span> (Vol. 26, p. 510), equivalent
in length to 70 pages of this Guide,
and fully illustrated, is by a number of
contributors, and discusses
both land lines
and submarine cables.
The section on
instruments, by H. R. Kempe, electrician
to the General Post Office, London, includes
a full description of the transmitters
and receivers employed in the various
systems of wireless telegraphy. <span class='sc'>Telephone</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 547) deals with the
fixed and portable instruments, the batteries
and switchboards, the new automatic
exchange “selectors,” and with
special applications of the microphone.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of other electric appliances
are discussed in separate articles, such as
<span class='sc'>Bell</span> (Vol. 3, p. 692), by H. M. Ross, in
which burglar alarm devices are described;
and <span class='sc'>Ventilation</span>, <i>Fan</i> (Vol. 27,
p. 1011), by James Bartlett; while sparking
plugs and other ignition appliances
are treated under <span class='sc'>Oil Engine</span> (Vol. 20,
p. 35).</p>

<p class='c007'>There are also a number of appliances
used mostly in experimental and educational
work. Such, for instance, are
<span class='sc'>Electrical or Electrostatic Machine</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 176), with many illustrations;
<span class='sc'>Electrophorus</span> (Vol. 9, p. 237), and
<span class='sc'>Leyden Jar</span> (Vol. 16, p. 528).</p>

<p class='c007'>The metals, chemicals and other materials

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='c014'>FOR MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS OF CHEMICALS AND DRUGS</span></h3>
</div>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>A Factor in All Industries</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The chemical and drug industry is
not only in itself an enormous
business, but it supplies essential
materials for almost every branch of
manufacturing. Chemical products are
employed in our buildings, our clothing,
our food; we come into the world and go
out of the world with the odour of chemicals
about us. The manufacturer or
dealer cannot analyze all the influences
that affect his market, and when he tries,
as he must, to consider the future of the
trade, to reckon with
the channels of demand
that will arise
in the course of new
applications of chemical products, he is
facing all the problems of all the industries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The variety of raw materials from
which chemical products are derived, and
the activity with which new sources are
discovered and developed, are almost
as bewildering. Only a century has
passed since coal-tar was first distilled,
and to-day no chemist would venture to
fix the limits of its industrial possibilities.
Electrolysis has been in use since 1804,
and yet the future of the world’s wheat
supply probably depends upon processes,
as yet hardly beyond the experimental
stage, of utilizing atmospheric nitrogen.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with so comprehensive
an industry, the uses of the Britannica
are so manifold that this whole Guide
might be devoted to them. Articles on
every manufacturing process touch upon
the use of chemicals. The articles on
countries, states and cities are full of relevant
information; and there is hardly a
scientific article that would not be helpful.
But the 40 general articles on chemistry,
the 350 on chemical compounds,
and the 75 on manufactured products call
most immediately for attention; and, with
the aid of other chapters in the Guide, the
reader who desires to go further will easily
find his way.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Articles on Chemicals</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Chemistry</span> (Vol. 6, p. 33),
equivalent to 135 pages of this Guide,
is divided into 6
sections. The first,
<i>History</i>, traces the
general trend of the
science from its infancy to the foundations
of the modern theory. The second
section, <i>Principles</i>, treats of nomenclature,
formulæ, chemical equations and
chemical changes. It provides a brief
but complete introduction to the terminology
and methods of the chemist, and
there is not a line in it which will not
prove of value in some way or other to
the chemical manufacturer. Sections 3
and 4 are devoted to <i>Inorganic and Organic
Chemistry</i>, giving a history of the
subjects and the principles underlying the
structure of compounds, with cross references
to all articles dealing with their
preparation and properties. Sections 5
and 6 deal, respectively, with <i>Analytical</i>
and <i>Physical Chemistry</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Walter Nernst, professor of physical
chemistry, University of Berlin, is
the author of <span class='sc'>Chemical Action</span> (Vol. 6,
p. 26), which deals specifically with the
nature of chemical forces and deduces the
laws of chemical statics and kinetics. Of
interest and importance in connection
with the manufacture of chemicals is
<span class='sc'>Solution</span> (Vol. 25, p. 368), by W. C. D.
Whetham, of Cambridge University, author
of <i>Theory of Solution</i>, etc. Another
theoretical article which will be found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>widely useful is <span class='sc'>Thermochemistry</span> (Vol.
26, p. 804), by Prof. James Walker, of
Edinburgh University. For further details
see the chapter on <span class='sc'>Chemistry</span> in
this Guide.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Manufacture of Chemicals</div>

<p class='c007'>It is possible here to mention only a
small amount of the material dealing with
the manufacture of chemicals. At the
end of this chapter
there is a fuller alphabetical
list. It
may be noted, however,
that the articles on the elements,
metallic and non-metallic, give much consideration
to their compounds, how these
are made and how used in the arts and in
medicine. But in addition to this there
are many noteworthy contributions dealing
with chemical manufacture. For instance,
<span class='sc'>Alkali Manufacture</span> (Vol. 1,
p. 674), by Dr. Georg Lunge, professor of
technical chemistry, Zurich Polytechnic,
11 pages in length and with 10 illustrations.
The chief processes described are
the Leblanc, ammonia-soda, and electrolytic,
together with others dependent
upon them. The facts about the manufacture
of the carbonate, hydrate, and
sulphate of soda, chlorine, hydrochloric
acid, etc., are fully given. <span class='sc'>Potassium</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 197) treats of the commercial
compounds of this metal in the same
manner. <span class='sc'>Nitrogen</span> (Vol. 19, p. 714) explains
the new process for the commercial
manufacture of nitric acid from atmospheric
air—a matter of enormous industrial
importance—and also the conversion
of nitrogen into ammonia, which has been
done successfully only within the past
few years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manufacture of chemical products
by the use of electricity is the subject of
<span class='sc'>Electrochemistry</span> (Vol. 9, p. 208), and
a still larger field is covered by <span class='sc'>Electrometallurgy</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 232). Both of
these valuable articles are by W. G. M‘Millan,
formerly secretary of the Institute
of Electrical Engineers of Great
Britain. <span class='sc'>Sulphuric Acid</span> (Vol. 26, p. 65),
illustrated, by Dr. Lunge, describes the
properties, reactions and manufacture of
the most important of all chemicals, including
the more modern contact processes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Drugs, Origin and Manufacture</div>

<p class='c007'>As a key to the subject of the origin
and manufacture of drugs, the article
<span class='sc'>Pharmacology</span> (Vol. 21, p. 347), by Dr.
Ralph Stockman,
professor of materia
medica and therapeutics
in the University
of Glasgow,
presents a great amount of interesting
and valuable information on the action of
chemical substances (apart from foods)
on all kinds of animals, from bacteria up
to man. A short history of pharmacology
is given and a large part of the article
concerns the action of drugs. There is
also a classification of drugs according to
the latest and most scientific methods
into twenty-eight groups, describing the
effects of each group. An appendix to
the article, by Dr. H. L. Hennessy, is
entitled <i>Terminology in Therapeutics</i>, and
is a general explanation of the common
names used in the therapeutic classification
of drugs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since therapeutics is concerned with
the remedial power of drugs and the conditions
under which they are to be used,
the article <span class='sc'>Therapeutics</span> (Vol. 26, p.
793), by Dr. Sir Lauder Brunton, of St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, and
author of the well-known treatise, <i>Modern
Therapeutics</i>, should not be overlooked,
nor <span class='sc'>Poison</span> (Vol. 21, p. 893), by Dr. Sir
Thomas Stevenson, lecturer on chemistry
and forensic medicine at Guy’s Hospital,
London, wherein all poisons are classified
and their antidotes are indicated.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pharmacy</span> (Vol. 21, p. 355), by E. M.
Holmes, of the Pharmaceutical Museum,
London, is largely historical in its nature,
and yields much interesting and valuable
information about the pharmacist. We
learn that an Egyptian papyrus of the
date 2300 B.C. gives direction as to the
preparation of prescriptions, and that
diachylon plaster, invented by Menecrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in A.D. 1, is used for the same
purposes to-day. A great deal of curious
knowledge about ancient remedies, such
as the thigh bone of a hanged man, moss
grown on a human skull, the ashes of the
head of a coal-black cat, etc., renders this
article especially entertaining. <span class='sc'>Pharmacopœia</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 353), also by Mr.
Holmes, tells about the pharmacopœias
in use in different countries, the standardization
of drugs, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the list at the end of this chapter are
noted the numerous separate articles on
drugs, their preparation and use that appear
in the Britannica. Mention should
be made of the articles on the elements,
such as <span class='sc'>Iron</span> (Vol. 14, p. 799), <span class='sc'>Arsenic</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 653), <span class='sc'>Mercury</span> (Vol. 18, p.
158), <span class='sc'>Iodine</span> (Vol. 14, p. 725), <span class='sc'>Bromine</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 633), <span class='sc'>Sodium</span> (Vol. 25, p. 343),
<span class='sc'>Potassium</span> (Vol. 22, p. 200), <span class='sc'>Magnesium</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 321), <span class='sc'>Bismuth</span> (Vol. 4, p. 11).
Separate sections dealing with pharmacology
are found in the articles on
very many plants, such as <span class='sc'>Aloe</span> (Vol.
1, p. 720), <span class='sc'>Anise</span> (Vol. 2, p. 55),
<span class='sc'>Arrowroot</span> (Vol. 2, p. 649), <i>Iceland
Moss</i> (Vol. 14, p. 241), <span class='sc'>Cinchona</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 369), <span class='sc'>Coca</span> (Vol. 6, p. 614),
<span class='sc'>Colchicum</span> (Vol. 6, p. 661), <span class='sc'>Dandelion</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 801), <span class='sc'>Hop</span> (Vol. 13, p. 678),
<span class='sc'>Horehound</span> (Vol. 13, p. 692), <span class='sc'>Lobelia</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 837), <span class='sc'>Mint</span> (Vol. 18, p. 557),
<span class='sc'>Mustard</span> (Vol. 19, p. 97), <span class='sc'>Peppermint</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 128), etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Biographies of Eminent Scientists</div>

<p class='c007'>The scientific biographies include not a
few subjects which will be of interest,
owing to familiarity with the names, to
those engaged in the
chemical and drug
business. Among
these are <span class='sc'>Lister,
Baron Joseph L.</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 777), to whose work and
teaching the present importance of the
manufacture of antiseptics is largely
due; <span class='sc'>Pasteur, Louis</span> (Vol. 20, p. 892);
<span class='sc'>Curie, Pierre</span>, and <span class='sc'>Mme. Marie Curie</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 644), the physicists who
first announced the existence of radium;
<span class='sc'>Liebig, Baron J. von</span> (Vol. 16,
p. 590), the great physiological chemist;
<span class='sc'>Lunge, Georg</span> (Vol. 17, p. 126), the
noted expert in technical chemistry, already
mentioned as a contributor to the
Britannica, and <span class='sc'>Glauber, J. R.</span> (Vol. 12,
p. 114), the German chemist who made
a living chiefly by the sale of secret
chemical and medicinal preparations.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='c014'>FOR MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS OF FOOD PRODUCTS</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The manufacturer of or dealer in
food products must of necessity be
interested in questions of transportation
by land and sea, of taxation, of
agriculture, stock-raising and fishing, for
example. For all such subjects as these
he is referred to other chapters of this
Guide. Here he will find only the chief
articles on the subjects most closely related
to the study of food products.
But on these he may glean a wealth of
information that will be of greatest value
to him, and from them he can turn
readily and with profit to a survey of the
larger area covered by other chapters.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a general introduction to the subject
the student should read <span class='sc'>Dietetics</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 214), by the late Dr. W. O.
Atwater, who was in charge of the Nutrition
Investigation of the U. S. Department
of Agriculture, and R. D. Milner,
also of that Department. This article
deals with the composition and nutritive
values of foods, their fuel value, quantities
of nutriments needed, hygienic and
pecuniary economy of foods (with tables
showing the percentage composition of
common food materials), conditions of
digestibility, and other matters of equal
importance. <span class='sc'>Nutrition</span> (Vol. 19, p.
920), by Prof. D. N. Paton and Dr. E. P.
Cathcart, both of the University of
Glasgow, discusses more particularly digestion
and the utilization of the different
food constituents.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Food Preservation</div>

<p class='c007'>After establishing the value and relative
importance of the various substances
used as food, it is of great interest to
everyone in the business to consider the
subject of <span class='sc'>Food Preservation</span> (Vol.
10, p. 612), an article by Otto Hehner,
formerly president of the Society of Public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Analysts, in which there are separate
sections on <i>Preservation by Heat</i> (which
includes all canning
processes); <i>by Chemicals</i>;
<i>by Drying</i>;
<i>by Refrigeration</i>; <i>by
Pickling</i>. The sterilization of milk, condensed
milk and milk powder all fall
within the scope of this article. The
preservation of food by cold is described
in fuller detail in the article <span class='sc'>Refrigerating
and Ice Making</span> (Vol. 23, p. 30), by
T. B. Lightfoot, author of the standard
technical book on that subject. Among
the separate articles on preservative materials
are <span class='sc'>Vinegar</span> (Vol. 28, p. 96),
<span class='sc'>Acetic Acid</span> (Vol. 1, p. 135), <span class='sc'>Citric
Acid</span> (Vol. 6, p. 397), <span class='sc'>Oils</span> (Vol. 20, p.
43), <span class='sc'>Salt</span> (Vol. 24, p. 87), <span class='sc'>Saltpetre</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 93), <span class='sc'>Sugar</span> (Vol. 26, p. 32),
<span class='sc'>Borax</span> (Vol. 4, p. 243), <span class='sc'>Formalin or
Formaldehyde</span> (Vol. 10, p. 667), <span class='sc'>Benzoic
Acid</span> (Vol. 3, p. 756), <span class='sc'>Salicylic
Acid</span> (Vol. 24, p. 69), <span class='sc'>Sulphur</span>, <i>Compounds</i>
(Vol. 26, p. 63), <span class='sc'>Alcohol</span> (Vol.
1, p. 525).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Adulteration</div>

<p class='c007'>The objections to the use of some of
these chemicals are discussed in <span class='sc'>Adulteration</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 218), by Otto Hehner.
This article is about as long as 50
pages of this Guide. There is an interesting
historical introduction, from which
we learn that the first legal statute in
which the adulteration
of food is noticed
dates from the
reign of King John in England (1203).
There is an elaborate account of all the
subsequent legislation in Great Britain,
the United States, and Germany. The
effects upon digestion of the chemical
preservatives mentioned above are shown
in the light of the very latest investigations.
There is a section on colouring
matter in food, with information about
harmless and harmful dyes; and the last
part of the article considers adulteration
as recently applied to the more important
articles of food, such as milk (with tests
for borax and formaldehyde), cream,
butter, cheese, lard, oils, flour and bread,
sugar, marmalade and jams, tea, coffee,
cocoa and chocolate, wine, beer, spirits,
non-alcoholic drinks, and vinegar.</p>

<p class='c007'>The properties of adulterants and colouring
matters are described in separate
articles, such as <span class='sc'>Glucose</span> (Vol. 12, p.
141); <span class='sc'>Saccharin</span> (Vol. 23, p. 970); <span class='sc'>Paraffin</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 752), which is sometimes
added to coffee when it is roasted;
<span class='sc'>Alum</span> (Vol. 1, p. 766), often used with
weak and unstable flours in bread making,
and unwholesome, although not strictly
speaking an adulterant; <span class='sc'>Sago</span> (Vol. 23, p.
1003) and <span class='sc'>Arrowroot</span> (Vol. 2, p. 649),
which provide adulterants of cocoa;
<span class='sc'>Chicory</span> (Vol. 6, p. 131), which many
consumers insist upon using in their
coffee; <span class='sc'>Copper</span>, <i>Compounds</i> (Vol. 7, p.
109), which describes the copper salts
used for colouring canned vegetables;
<span class='sc'>Anatto</span> (Vol. 1, p. 943) and <span class='sc'>Turmeric</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 474), two harmless vegetable
colouring matters, much employed; and
<span class='sc'>Aniline</span> (Vol. 2, p. 47). A full list of
the various other colouring matters will
be found in the article <span class='sc'>Dyeing</span> (Vol. 8,
p. 744).</p>

<p class='c007'>Another group of articles will be found
particularly useful in connection with the
manufacture of certain classes of food
products. Among these are <span class='sc'>Fermentation</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 275), by J. L. Baker, the
noted English analytical and consulting
chemist; <span class='sc'>Fungi</span> (Vol. 11, p. 333), illustrated,
with its information about molds;
<span class='sc'>Bacteriology</span> (Vol. 3, p. 156), illustrated,
especially for the material relating
to the nature of toxins (p. 174)—both of
these articles by the late Professor Ward
of Cambridge and Professor Blackman of
the University of Leeds; <span class='sc'>Medical Jurisprudence</span>,
<i>Food Poisoning</i> (Vol. 18, p.
29), by Prof. H. H. Littlejohn, of the
University of Edinburgh, and T. A. Ingram;
and <span class='sc'>Poison</span> (Vol. 21, p. 893), by
the late Dr. Sir Thomas Stevenson, of
Guy’s Hospital, London.</p>

<p class='c007'>The diseases of animals which affect
meat are described in the article <span class='sc'>Veterinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Science</span> (Vol. 28, p. 2), by George
Fleming, author of <i>Animal Plagues</i>, and
Prof. John MacQueen of the London Veterinary
College, which contains sections
on diseases of cattle, sheep and pigs as
well as on the principal parasites of domestic
animals; and there are separate articles
on <span class='sc'>Anthrax</span> (Vol. 2, p. 106); <span class='sc'>Foot
and Mouth Disease</span> (Vol. 10, p. 617),
<span class='sc'>Pleuro-Pneumonia</span>, or <span class='sc'>Lung Plague</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 838), and <span class='sc'>Rinderpest</span> (Vol.
23, p. 348).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Special Foods</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Flour and Flour Manufacture</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 548), by George F.
Zimmer, not only describes the processes
of milling and of
dressing and bleaching
the flour, but
also gives the history of milling from the
earliest times, and deals with the special
customs of different countries. There is
a very full article <span class='sc'>Bread</span> (Vol. 4, p. 465),
by the same contributor. It is not generally
known that there are in existence
remains of cakes made by the Swiss lake-dwellers
in the Stone Age. The author
says that, in all probability, they were
baked on hot stones. The machine
bakeries of the present day are described;
and there are sections on sanitation of
bakehouses, quality, flavour and colour of
flour, baking powders, methods of dough
making (the ferment-and-dough, the
sponge-and-dough, and other systems),
leavened, unleavened and aerated bread,
and the recently invented Apostolov process,
which among other advantages, permits
the utilization of about 87½% of
the wheat berry in bread making. A
complete modern bread-making plant is
described, together with the latest types
of machine kneaders, dough dividers and
mixers, and baking ovens. There are
also articles on <span class='sc'>Biscuit</span> (Vol. 3, p. 992),
<span class='sc'>Macaroni</span> (Vol. 17, p. 192), <span class='sc'>Vermicelli</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 1024), and <span class='sc'>Gluten</span> (Vol. 12,
p. 145).</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Starch</span> (Vol. 25, p. 794)
treats of the manufacture of this most
important alimentary substance. The
materials from which the chief food
starches are made are described in <span class='sc'>Maize</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 448), <span class='sc'>Arrowroot</span> (Vol. 2, p.
649), with illustrations showing the appearance
under the microscope of the
substances which pass commercially under
the name of arrowroot or farina;
<span class='sc'>Sago</span> (Vol. 23, p. 1003), <span class='sc'>Tapioca</span> (Vol.
26, p. 413), and <span class='sc'>Cassava</span> (Vol. 5, p. 457).
<span class='sc'>Oat</span> (Vol. 19, p. 938) has information
about the manufacture of oatmeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Sugar</span> (Vol. 26, p. 35) is by
two practical experts, Alfred and Valentine
W. Chapman. It deals with the
chemistry, manufacture, history and
statistics of this important food product
as well as with the cultivation of the
sugar cane and beet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among articles on the products in the
manufacture of which sugar is employed
is <span class='sc'>Jams and Jellies</span> (Vol. 15, p. 150), by
Otto Hehner. The author points out
many things of interest, for example why
starch-glucose is an ingredient and not an
adulterant of these products, and he shows
the baselessness of the prejudice against
the use of beet sugar in their manufacture.
The manufacturer of jellies and
preserves will find separate articles on all
the fruits employed, and other information
in <span class='sc'>Gelatin</span> (Vol. 11, p. 554); in
<span class='sc'>Irish Moss</span> (Vol. 14, p. 795) as to the
properties of vegetable gelatin; and in
<span class='sc'>Isinglass</span> (Vol. 14, p. 872), which, besides
its gelatinous qualities, possesses the
property of clarifying wines, beers, and
other liquids. <span class='sc'>Confectionery</span> (Vol. 6,
p. 898) describes an important industry—which
until the middle of the 19th century
was part of the druggist’s business.
See also <span class='sc'>Chocolate</span> (Vol. 6, p. 259) and
<span class='sc'>Jujube</span> (Vol. 15, p. 546).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Salt</span> (Vol. 24, p. 87) covers the manufacture
of salt very fully. It is curious
to note that the termination “wich” in
English place-names points to localities
of ancient salt manufacture, for “wich”
is an old English word meaning saltspring.
This article contains an interesting
section on the <i>Ancient History and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Religious Symbolism</i> of salt (p. 90), by the
late Dr. William Robertson Smith. The
preservative qualities of salt were held to
make it a peculiarly fitting symbol of any
enduring compact, and in more than one
part of the world cakes of salt have been
used as money.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dairy Products</div>

<p class='c007'>Butter and cheese manufacture fall
under the article <span class='sc'>Dairy and Dairy
Farming</span> (Vol. 7, p. 737), illustrated, by
the late Dr. William
Fream, of Edinburgh
University.
There are sections
on <i>Milk Production</i>; <i>Cheese and Cheesemaking</i>,
including Canadian and American
factory practice and the Babcock
and Russell investigations in Wisconsin
which have opened up a new field for
commercial exploitation (the varieties of
English, French, German, and Italian
cheeses being also described); <i>Butter and
Butter-making</i>, <i>Dairy Factories</i>, <i>Adulteration
of Dairy Produce</i>; <i>The Milk Trade</i>,
<i>American Dairying</i>, etc. <span class='sc'>Margarine</span>,
the “perfectly wholesome butter substitute”
is the subject of a separate article
(Vol. 17, p. 704).</p>

<p class='c007'>There is an article on <span class='sc'>Lard</span> (Vol. 16, p.
214), showing what real leaf lard is, and
how the term is applied in commerce.
<span class='sc'>Oils</span> (Vol. 20, p. 43), by Dr. Julius Lewkowitsch,
author of <i>Chemical Technology
and Analysis of Oils, Fats, and Waxes</i>,
deals with the fixed oils and fats, and
essential, etheral or volatile oils. Some
of these are among the most important
articles of food, and the oil and fat industry
may be considered as old as the
human race itself. The three processes
of oil extraction are described, also refining
and bleaching, methods of testing,
etc. A list of all oils and fats, including
those that are edible, is given. For the
chief oils used as food see <span class='sc'>Olive</span> (Vol. 20,
p. 85), <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, <i>Cotton-seed</i> (Vol. 7, p.
260), <span class='sc'>Sesame</span> (Vol. 24, p. 701), <span class='sc'>Sunflower</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 102), <span class='sc'>Poppy Oil</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 91).</p>

<p class='c007'>Other articles on foods deal with the
preparation for the market of such products
as <span class='sc'>Ginger</span> (Vol. 12, p. 27), <span class='sc'>Mustard</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 97), <span class='sc'>Pepper</span> (Vol. 21, p.
127), with the different varieties distinguished,
<span class='sc'>Cayenne Pepper</span> (Vol. 5, p.
589), <span class='sc'>Vinegar</span> (Vol. 28, p. 96), <span class='sc'>Pimento</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 614), <span class='sc'>Cloves</span> (Vol. 6, p. 562),
<span class='sc'>Cinnamon</span> (Vol. 6, p. 376), <span class='sc'>Curry</span> (Vol.
7, p. 649), <span class='sc'>Caviare</span> (Vol. 5, p. 582), from
which we learn that the finer grades
rarely find their way out of Russia; <span class='sc'>Ketchup</span>
(Vol. 15, p. 761), <span class='sc'>Chutney</span> (Vol. 6,
p. 350), <span class='sc'>Pickle</span> (Vol. 21, p. 584), <span class='sc'>Vanilla</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 894), <span class='sc'>Raisin</span> (Vol. 22, p.
864), <span class='sc'>Currant</span> (Vol. 7, p. 648), <span class='sc'>Prune</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 518), <span class='sc'>Fig</span> (Vol. 10, p. 332), and
<span class='sc'>Guava</span> (Vol. 12, p. 665).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beverages, Tea and Coffee</div>

<p class='c007'>The same completeness is displayed in
the Britannica articles on beverages. <span class='sc'>Tea</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 476), by John McEwan, has
an admirable historical
introduction.
It was not until the
middle of the 17th
century that the English began to use tea.
It is a curious fact that whereas 35 years
ago China practically supplied the world
with tea, to-day Russia alone takes half
of her export. The reason for this is explained.
The characteristics of all varieties
of tea are given and the main facts
about the cultivation and manufacture.
<i>Tea Adulteration</i> and <i>Effects on Health</i> are
other sections of this valuable article.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Coffee</span> (Vol. 6, p. 646) is treated in
very similar fashion by A. B. Rendle and
W. G. Freeman. This beverage, in spite
of fierce religious opposition, became the
national beverage of the Arabians, and
finally appeared in Europe in the 17th
century. The physiological action of
coffee has a section all to itself. Coffee
consumption, roasting and adulteration
are also discussed. It is of interest to
note that while one branch of the Anglo-Saxon
race, namely the people of the
United States, is near the head of the
list of coffee consumers, others, especially
Great Britain, Canada and Australia
“are almost at the foot, using only about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>1 lb. of coffee per head each year.” In the
United States “the average consumption
per head is about 11 or 12 lbs. per
annum.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cocoa</span> (Vol. 6, p. 628) is an interesting
and valuable article on “the food of the
gods”—the great beverage and dietary
substance which America has given the
world. Modern lovers of chocolate as a
beverage (which is the same as cocoa
save that the fat has not been extracted)
will envy the digestive powers of the
Emperor Montezuma of Mexico who had,
each day, 50 jars of chocolate prepared
for his personal consumption.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Beer</span> (Vol. 3, p. 642), by Dr. Philip
Schidrowitz, member of the Institute of
Brewery Council, confines itself to the
history of this important beverage, the
chemical composition of beers of different
types, and information in regard to production
and consumption. In <span class='sc'>Brewing</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 506) this same author enters
very fully into the manufacturing operations.
The English and foreign systems
are described and there are many illustrations.
It is curious to note that Pliny,
who is the earliest writer to mention
beer, describes it as scorned by the Romans,
who looked upon it as only fit for
barbarians, and he thought it a more sinful
drink than wine. “So exquisite,” he
says, “is the cunning of mankind in
gratifying their vicious appetites, that
they have invented a method to make
water itself produce intoxication.” The
section on <i>Brewing Chemistry</i> is very
valuable. In connection with Brewing
there is an article on <span class='sc'>Malt</span> (Vol. 17, p.
499), illustrated and very complete in its
treatment, by Arthur R. Ling, editor
<i>Journal of the Institute of Brewing</i>, and
one on <span class='sc'>Hop</span> (Vol. 13, p. 677), by the late
Dr. Wm. Fream. Dr. Schidrowitz also
contributes the article <span class='sc'>Wine</span> (Vol. 28, p.
716). The art of wine-making is thoroughly
described, and there are most interesting
sections on the wines of France,
Spain, Portugal, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary,
United States, classifying
the different varieties and affording a full
survey of the industry.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Spirits</span> (Vol. 25, p. 694), illustrated,
and also by Dr. Schidrowitz, is a general
article covering the subject of the distillation
of fermented saccharine and starchy
liquids. The account is both historical
and technical, and there are separate and
more specific articles on <span class='sc'>Brandy</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 428), <span class='sc'>Rum</span> (Vol. 23, p. 825), <span class='sc'>Arrack</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 642), <span class='sc'>Whisky</span> (Vol. 28, p. 591),
in which the difference between three
main types—Scotch, Irish and American—is
carefully explained; <span class='sc'>Vodka</span> (Vol. 28,
p. 170), <span class='sc'>Gin</span> (Vol. 12, p. 26). The many
flavoured and sweetened forms of alcohol
are described in the article <span class='sc'>Liqueurs</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 744), where we also learn the
difference between a “cordial” and a
“liqueur.” There are separate articles on
<span class='sc'>Absinthe</span> (Vol. 1, p. 75), <span class='sc'>Benedictine</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 721), <span class='sc'>Chartreuse</span> (Vol. 5, p.
954), <span class='sc'>Curaçoa</span> (Vol. 7, p. 636), <span class='sc'>Kirsch</span>
(Vol. 15, p. 834), and <span class='sc'>Vermouth</span> (Vol.
27, p. 1029).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mineral Waters</span> (Vol. 18, p. 517)
classifies all the great springs according
to their mineral constituents, and discusses
the effects upon digestion of their
use, and their value in medical treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appended list includes a large
number of articles of interest to the food
producers, including chemical compounds
and flavouring extracts.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='c014'>FOR INSURANCE MEN</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>For the insurance man, whether
veteran or tyro, the new <span class='sc'>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</span> has much of
value and importance, <i>and it has it in
quickly available form so that the desired
information may be readily found</i>, whether
the experienced student wants an authoritative
statement on a difficult point,
or the beginner wishes an outline course
of the subject. This availability, whether
for the expert or the novice, is secured by
the Index (the 29th volume), which guides
the reader immediately to desired information,
if he does not find it in the alphabetically
arranged articles in the body of
the book upon first turning up the article
in which he expects the subject to be
treated.</p>

<p class='c007'>To be more concrete—if you want to
know something about insurance, turn
first to the article <span class='sc'>Insurance</span> in Volume
14, beginning on p. 656. You find an
elaborate article, which would occupy
about 75 pages if printed in type and on
a page like this Guide.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>In other encyclopaedias</i> you would have
no clue to the whereabouts of any information
about insurance except what
would be given in the article <span class='sc'>Insurance</span>
or in articles to which it might refer you
in that article. For anything else you
would have to guess how the editor’s mind
had worked to find where in the book he
had put other information about insurance;
and to guess how each contributor’s
mental processes have been related to his
interest in insurance so that you might
know whether in some article, on a topic
apparently not related to insurance at all,
the contributor had put in some interesting
and important fact about insurance.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the Britannica you have one entire
volume, the 29th, which was made
for the sole purpose of increasing the
practical efficiency of the other 28 volumes.
Under the heading <i>Insurance</i> in
this index, you will find references to
many articles and cross references to
Title Insurance and to Title Guarantee
Companies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apart from the fact that he has the initial
<i>assurance</i> that what he gets from the
Britannica in the first place is fuller and
better than he would get from another
work of reference, what are the advantages
offered by the index in this particular
instance?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>First</i>: Instead of having a reference to
volume 14 only he has references to volumes
2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18,
19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28,—nineteen
volumes in all,—say a gain of 1800%
in efficiency.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Second</i>: Instead of having one article
Insurance to refer to, he has reference to
specific information in the following articles:</p>

<ul class='index'>
  <li class='c018'><i>Annuity</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Austria</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Average</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Barratry</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Bonus</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Employers’ Liability</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Fire and Fire Extinction</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Friendly Societies</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Gaming and Wagering</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Guarantee</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Income Tax</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Infanticide</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Japan</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Land Registration</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Lloyds</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Mensuration</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Novation</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Old Age Pensions</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Post Office</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Probability</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Shipbuilding</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Socialism</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Switzerland</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Title Guarantee Companies</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Tontine</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Underwriter</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Unemployment</i>,</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Warranty</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>That is, to 28 new articles,—say 2800%
additional gain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Observe, too, that this is a gain that
cannot be expressed in figures. The index
references are classified. First there
is a main head <i>Insurance</i>; then subheads,
<i>Fire</i>, <i>Life</i>, <i>Marine</i>, <i>Title</i>, <i>Workmen’s</i>; and
under the subheads special topics arranged
alphabetically.</p>

<p class='c007'>In brief, the Index facilitates and accelerates
reference to anything in the
Britannica that bears on any desired
topic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Insurance</span> opens with a
definition of that word and with drawing
a distinction between it and “assurance.”
The general history of insurance traces
marine insurance back to Greek commerce
in the 4th century B.C., but shows
that modern methods of marine insurance
were unknown until the 14th century;
that fire insurance dates from the
17th century and especially from the
Great Fire of London in 1666; and that,
although there were a few instances of
life insurance in the 16th and 17th centuries,
it did not become a regular business
until the 18th century and was not
widely extended until the 19th century.
Separate sections of the article deal with
<i>Casualty</i> (or accident) and <i>Miscellaneous
Insurance</i>, <i>Fire Insurance</i>, <i>Life Insurance</i>,
<i>British Post Office Insurance</i>, and <i>Marine
Insurance</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The section on British Post-Office Insurance
will give to the American insurance
man a knowledge of this innovation
in the post-office to which the American
post-office seems to be tending, if one
may judge by the introduction of
postal savings-banks and the adoption of
the parcels-post system.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same way the article <span class='sc'>Old Age
Pensions</span> will make you acquainted with
another radical measure which has been
adopted in Great Britain, Germany,
France, Denmark, Victoria and notably
New Zealand, with fuller description in
the article <span class='sc'>New Zealand</span>. The importance
of the subject to the American insurance
man lies in the fact that similar
schemes are under consideration or actual
operation in Massachusetts, New Jersey,
and other states of the United States. In
the same way the article on <span class='sc'>Employers
Liability</span> and <span class='sc'>Workmen’s Insurance</span>
will give him a wider grasp of the subject
of state insurance, mandatory or elective,
for workmen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal articles on insurance topics
have already been mentioned. It is to
be noted, however, that the actuary will
find important information in the mathematical
articles <span class='sc'>Mensuration</span> and <span class='sc'>Probability</span>;
that the article <span class='sc'>Friendly Societies</span>
is supplemented by such special
articles as <span class='sc'>Free Masonry</span>, <span class='sc'>B’nai Brith</span>,
<span class='sc'>Building Societies</span>, <span class='sc'>Burial Societies</span>,
<span class='sc'>Odd Fellows</span>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the <i>Classified List of Articles</i> in the
Index Volume the student of insurance
will find on page 893 a list of articles in
the field of economics and social science,
many of which will bear more or less directly
on the subject. Among these articles
and sub-articles are:</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='c014'>FOR ARCHITECTS</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Although architecture is more
and more coming to be recognized
as one of the fine arts, it is
at the same time so largely practical and
utilitarian that its theory and methods
may to a great extent be gathered from
systematic reading. In the article Fine
Arts in the Britannica, by Sir Sidney
Colvin, it is well said that “The original
or rudimentary type of the architect,
considered not as a mere builder but as
an artist, is the savage, who, when his
tribe had taken to live in tents or huts
instead of caves, first arranged the skins
and timbers of his tent or hut in one way
because it pleased his eye, rather than in
some other way which was as good for
shelter.” Whether the architect wishes
to learn how the eye may be pleased, to
study critically the history of architecture,
or, like the less imaginative savage
who failed of being the first inspired
architect, to consider comfort and shelter
rather than beauty and charm, he will
find much to help him in the Britannica.
If his interest is chiefly practical, he
should consult the chapter <i>For Builders</i>
in this Guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>The architect should read first—and
he will constantly be referring to it
afterwards—the article <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 369), equivalent in length to
235 pages of this Guide and illustrated
by 140 figures, about one-third of which
are photogravures. The article is historical
in the main and a brief outline
of it is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The part of the article dealing with
Modern Architecture is by H. H. Statham
author of a well-known book on the subject.
Earlier sections are by R. Phené
Spiers, late master of the Royal Academy’s
Architectural School, with sections
on the Romanesque and Gothic in France
by W. R. Lethaby, principal of the Central
(London County) School of Arts and
Crafts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before continuing his more systematic
historical readings the student may well
read the article <span class='sc'>House</span> (Vol. 13, p. 810),
illustrated with 12 figures (3 plates),
including four particularly fine examples
of “half timbered buildings,” and one
English house, the Jew’s House at Lincoln,
dating from the 12th century. An
interesting article on <span class='sc'>Mural Decoration</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 16) is by a remarkably
distinguished trio: William Morris, poet,
craftsman and painter, John Henry
Middleton, late Slade professor of fine
art, Cambridge, and Walter Crane, the
well-known illustrator and decorator.
This is illustrated with 16 figures in black
and white and with a reproduction in
colours of a wall-painting from a Roman
villa of the early Empire. The article
deals with: reliefs in marble and stone;
marble veneer; glazed bricks or tiles;
hard stucco; sgraffito; stamped leather;
painted cloth; printed hangings and wall-papers;
and painting.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the student of architecture would
know about the buildings of prehistoric
times, in which there was little architecture
in the sense of a fine art, he should
read the articles <span class='sc'>Archaeology</span>, (Vol. 2,
p. 344), <span class='sc'>Lake Dwellings</span> (Vol. 16, p. 91),
<span class='sc'>Stonehenge</span> (Vol. 25, p. 961) and <span class='sc'>Stone
Monuments, Primitive</span> (Vol. 25, p. 962),—the
last two of particular interest to
the building engineer because it is so
puzzling a problem how these great
blocks could have been brought such
distances and set in place without modern
appliances.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Early Oriental Architecture</div>

<p class='c007'>Engineering problems will be the most
interesting in a large part of the student’s
reading about Egyptian architecture.
Supplementing the
4,000 or 5,000 words
on this subject under
<span class='sc'>Architecture</span>,
accompanied by seven illustrations, there
is much information in the articles
<span class='sc'>Egypt</span> (Vol. 9, p. 21); <span class='sc'>Abydos</span> (Vol. 1,
p. 81) and <span class='sc'>Karnak</span> (Vol. 15, p. 680);
and in the articles <span class='sc'>Pyramid</span> (Vol. 22,
p. 683), (by W. M. Flinders Petrie) and
<span class='sc'>Sphinx</span> (Vol. 25, p. 662) by Francis
Llewellyn Griffith, another well-known
Egyptologist. In the former article the
author points out that the outside and
inside work on all the pyramids was excellent
and that the casings were not a
mere veneer but were “of massive blocks,
usually greater in thickness than in
height, and in some cases (as at South
Dahshur) reminding the observer of
horizontal leaves with sloping edges.”
The massive character of the roofing of
the sepulchral chambers is indicated by
Prof. Petrie’s estimate that “in Pepi’s
pyramid it is of three layers of stone
beams, each deeper than their breadth,
resting one on another, the thirty stones
weighing more than 30 tons each.” But
neither Stonehenge nor the pyramid was
really an engineering problem. Here, and
as in all his studies of early architecture,
artist or engineer will find religion and
worship the aim and the reason of the
building even more, if that is possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>than in the great European cathedrals of
comparatively recent times.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the article <span class='sc'>Babylonia</span> and <span class='sc'>Assyria</span>
there is a brief section (Vol. 3, p. 108)
on <i>Art</i>, supplementing the treatment
under <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>. It is interesting
to note that even in Assyria architecture
was trammelled, reactionary, governed by
Babylonian styles and using brick and
clay because Babylon did, although there
was stone in Assyria, and none in Babylonia;
and keeping the heavy brick
platform foundation which the Babylonian
architects had adopted because of
the marshy character of their country,
although there was no need of such construction
in Assyria. Here too the function
of architecture was largely as an
aid to religion: as shown in the article
<span class='sc'>Nippur</span> (Vol. 19, p. 707), with its description
of the “ziggurat” or artificial
mountain in the shrine, built probably
40 or 45 centuries B. C. One temple was
272 ft. square, with seven storeys, each
smaller than the one below and thus
surrounded by a terrace, each dedicated
to a planet, each coloured a separate
tint, the first probably 45 ft. high, and
the total height 160 ft.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Assyria great palaces of the 9th,
8th and 7th centuries B. C. have been
found, and these are probably the earliest
large buildings of any architectural importance
not religious in their purpose;
but this distinction must not be carried
too far, for the king was sacrosanct,
half priest and half god, and his palace
was a shrine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Greece and Rome</div>

<p class='c007'>Although the main treatment of Greek
and Roman architecture is in the article
<span class='sc'>Architecture</span>, the student should read
the articles <span class='sc'>Greek
Art</span> (Vol. 12, p. 470;
equivalent to 70
pages in this Guide;
written by Percy Gardner, author of
<i>Grammar of Greek Art</i>) and <span class='sc'>Roman Art</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 474; equivalent to 40 pages
of this Guide; written by H. Stuart Jones,
director of the British School at Rome).
The article on <span class='sc'>Greek Art</span> contains 82
illustrations, many of them halftones.
It makes clear the dependence of the other
fine arts in Greece on architecture—and
on religion—in showing that the greatest
sculptures were adjuncts to temples,
and (p. 471–472) in a discussion of the
architecture of Greek temples calls attention
to four basal principles of Greek
architecture:</p>

<p class='c020'>(1) Each member of the building
has one function and only one, and this
function controls even the decoration of
that member. Pillars support architraves;
their perpendicular flutings emphasize
this. Moulding at a column’s
base suggests the support of a great
weight.</p>

<p class='c020'>(2) Simple and natural relations
prevailed between various members of
a construction.</p>

<p class='c020'>(3) Rigidity of simple lines is
avoided; scarcely any outline is actually
straight. Columns are not equidistant.</p>

<p class='c020'>(4) Elaborate decoration is reserved
for those parts of the temple which
have, or seem to have, no strain laid
upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Temple</span> (Vol. 26, p. 603)
gives plans and general information
about Greek and Roman sacred architecture,
as well as Hebrew, Egyptian and
Assyrian temples; and the reader should
study the article <span class='sc'>Parthenon</span> (Vol. 20,
p. 869) and the diagram in that article,
and the article <span class='sc'>Pergamum</span> (Vol. 21, p.
142) and the two plates which accompany
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Roman Art</span> (Vol. 23, p. 474)
is probably the first brief and authoritative
treatment of a topic long overshadowed
in popular interest by the
earlier art of Greece and the later art
of Italy. It begins with a history of
recent research. Architecture, pre-eminently
the most Roman of the arts as
combining utility with beauty, is outlined
(pp. 476–477 especially) and the main
point in regard to Roman architecture is
brought out as follows: “the specific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>achievement of the Roman architect
was the artistic application of a new set
of principles—those which are expressed
in the arch, the vault and the dome,”
as contrasted with the rectilinear buildings
of the Greeks. The arch, particularly
the triumphal arch, is specifically a
Roman product and is specifically Roman
besides in being an expression of reverence
for governmental authority,—which, it
should, however, be remembered, cannot
be separated from religion. Among the
most important of Roman sculptures and
particularly reliefs are those of the arches,
described in the articles <span class='sc'>Arch</span> (Vol. 2,
p. 342) and <span class='sc'>Triumphal Arch</span> (Vol. 27,
p. 297), the latter with eight figures.
The part of the article <span class='sc'>Aqueduct</span> which
deals with Roman aqueducts (Vol. 2,
pp. 241–243, with 2 plates, 6 illustrations)
will interest the architect as well as the
contractor or engineer. And he should
read the article on the Roman architect
and writer on architecture, <span class='sc'>Vitruvius</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 150), whose book so strongly
affected the Renaissance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before taking up modern architecture
as distinguished from ancient, the student
will do well to examine the architecture
of some more remote peoples—for
instance,</p>

<ul class='index'>
  <li class='c018'><i>Aztec</i> (Vol. 5, p. 441 and p. 677)</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Abyssinian</i> (Vol. 12, p. 232)</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Hittite</i> (Vol. 13, p. 537)</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Indian</i> (Vol. 14, p. 428, with 4 plates)</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Japanese</i> (Vol. 15, pp. 181–182)</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Chinese</i> (Vol. 6, p. 214)</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Byzantine</i> (Vol. 4, p. 906, with 2 plates), and the article <span class='sc'>Constantinople</span> (Vol. 7, p. 3)</li>
</ul>

<div class='sidenote'>Modern Architecture</div>

<p class='c007'>The last topic will serve as a transition
to the modern architecture of Europe, especially
because the influence of the Byzantine
was so strong
in the early church.</p>

<p class='c007'>The study of the Italian Romanesque
and Gothic in an elaborate section of
<span class='sc'>Architecture</span> (Vol. 2, p. 391) may well
be supplemented by reading the articles
on the Italian cities in which this art
is preserved. The following list is roughly
chronological, the cities named first
being those in which there are the oldest
churches.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVI<br> <span class='c014'>FOR BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS</span></h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Builder’s Problems</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The rapid increase in population,
and especially in its density, the
congestion in great cities, with the
consequent building up of suburbs; and
the equally rapid upward tendency in the
scale of comfort, are factors of modern
civilization which make the work of the
builder and contractor increasingly complex.
The good builder is probably much
commoner than ever
before, in spite of the
popular impression
that building materials
are poorer and that construction
work is more often “scamped” than they
used to be. Increased transportation
facilities make the builder much less dependent
on local and often inadequate
materials. And there has been a change
in the theory and practice of government:
the old easy-going policy has been abandoned,
and new laws, strictly enforced,
have resulted in such inspection and
control of building operations as would
have seemed tyranny to the builder of a
generation ago and as make modern
buildings, especially in cities, much safer
than ever before. Insurance companies
have done much to the same end.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a general prejudice against the
modern builder on the part of the temperamental
“praiser of the past.” Occasionally
similar complaints are made even
against the builders of the past. Kipling
sings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Who shall doubt the secret hid</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Under Cheops’ pyramid</div>
      <div class='line'>Was that a contractor did</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cheops out of several millions?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or that Joseph’s sudden rise</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To Comptroller of Supplies</div>
      <div class='line'>Was a fraud of monstrous size</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On King Pharaoh’s swart civilians?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The mere duration of the pyramids, undamaged
except by the hand of man, is an
answer to such a charge; and in the Britannica
article <span class='sc'>Pyramid</span> the reader will
find (Vol. 22, p. 683) that even where the
hidden material was rubbly or of mud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>bricks, “the casings were not a mere
veneer, but were of massive blocks, usually
greater in thickness than in height”—in
other words, that the construction
was of the best character.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the builder must be a far better-informed
man under present conditions
than ever before. To give him the necessary
information there is a large and
growing literature ranging from builders’
and contractors’ pocket manuals to
special periodicals. This literature is expensive,
and like all special literature puts
the intending purchaser in a difficult position,
for <i>if he buys it all</i>, he must pay
much more than the returns from his purchase
warrant, and he will then have to
<i>read it all</i> and use his own judgment in
deciding what is best. If he does not buy
all, he must be an expert, not merely in
every branch of his business but in the
bibliography of his business, to make a
wise selection,—and if he is sufficiently
expert for this he will probably need no
such library. But he will find, to a remarkable
degree, the best of all that
there is in such special literature in the
Encyclopaedia Britannica, with the
strongest assurance of its being authoritative,
and with the certainty that for an
outlay, small in comparison with what
he would make for such special information
elsewhere, he will get the guidance
that he needs for his work and also information
as excellent on any other
subject that he or any member of his family
may wish to pursue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The key or foundation article for the
builder or contractor is <span class='sc'>Building</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 762), by James Bartlett, lecturer on
construction, etc., King’s College, London,
who has contributed other articles
on related topics. The article deals with:</p>

<p class='c020'>The relation of building to architecture
and with building laws and
special types of plans according
to local governmental requirements</p>

<p class='c020'>The conditions necessary for a successful
building, namely—ease of
access, good light, good service,
pleasing environment and approaches,
minimum cost with true
economy, and, for office buildings,
ease of arrangement to suit
tenants</p>

<p class='c020'>Construction, its general principles</p>

<p class='c020'>Materials of construction, especially
stone and brick</p>

<p class='c020'>Particular objects of construction</p>

<p class='c020'>Foundation walls</p>

<p class='c020'>Footings to walls</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVII<br> <span class='c014'>FOR DECORATORS AND DESIGNERS</span></h3>
</div>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>All the Arts in One</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The decorator and designer is a
specialist in his purposes rather
than in his methods, and his taste
and judgment must be based upon a wide
range of information. His selection and
combination of decorative factors call for
a knowledge of architectural design, of
painting, sculpture, furniture, textiles,
pottery, enamels, embroideries, laces and
all the other arts, crafts and products
that contribute to the perfecting of “the
house beautiful.” The variety of the
materials at his command offers him infinite
possibilities of successful achievement,
and as many temptations to incoherence
and exuberance. The highest
success in decoration can be attained only
when the designer
possesses the resources
of all these
arts and crafts, and
failure perhaps comes oftenest through
too exclusive a use of one medium of expression
because it is the one with which
the designer feels he can most competently
deal. The ideal should be not only
to employ, but to enlarge, the scope of
every contributory medium of form or
colour, as Wagner found new possibilities
in the use of every musical instrument in
one orchestra. This practical usefulness
of versatility is clearly indicated in one
of the articles, characteristic of the Britannica,
where one great expert writes
about the work of another. William
Morris and Walter Crane have been the
leaders of the modern revival of artistic
interest in the daily accessories of life;
and Crane in the Britannica (Vol. 2, p.
701) says of Morris that his influence is
to be attributed to his having “<i>personally
mastered the working details and handling
of each craft he took up in turn, as well as
to his power of inspiring his helpers and
followers. He was painter, designer,
scribe, illuminator, wood-engraver, dyer,
weaver and, finally, printer and paper-maker;
and, having effectively mastered
these crafts he could effectively direct and
criticize the work of others.</i>” Obviously,
few men can afford to devote forty years,
as Morris did, to the close study and actual
practice of all these pursuits, and
still fewer could hope to develop so many
manual dexterities. But any earnest student
can become a competent critic in all
these varied fields, and can retain an
equal appreciation of all the materials and
methods employed, if he will enlarge and
refresh his knowledge by constant reading
of the best authorities. The comprehensiveness
of the Britannica makes it,
for such purposes, invaluable to the designer
and decorator, no matter how
many technical books his working library
may contain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Influence of Architecture</div>

<p class='c007'>Since harmony of proportion, the essence
of architecture, is also the primary
law of interior decoration, the reader of
the present chapter
may well begin his
reading with a number
of the articles
described in the chapter <i>For Architects</i>, of
which only those dwelling most upon the
use of ornament and colour need be separately
mentioned in this connection. The
article <span class='sc'>Architecture</span> (Vol. 2, p. 369) is
by R. Phené Spiers, formerly master of
the Architectural School of the English
Royal Academy, with sections on special
periods and schools of architecture by
other famous authorities. Oriental architecture,
with its elaboration of detail, is
peculiarly suggestive to the decorator,
who may be surprised to find, in the
Britannica, treatises so highly specialized
as <span class='sc'>Indian Architecture</span> (Vol. 14, p.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>428), by Dr. James Burgess, editor of the
standard book on the subject, the <i>History
of Indian Architecture</i>; the architectural
part of <span class='sc'>China</span>, <i>Art</i> (Vol. 6, p. 214), by
Lawrence Binyon, whose work in the
great British Museum collection has
made his reputation as one of the foremost
modern critics; and <span class='sc'>Japan</span>, <i>Art</i>
(Vol. 15, p. 181), by Capt. Frank Brinkley,
whose many years of study in Japan
have given him an exceptional mastery
of the subject. Among other articles
dealing with the decorative aspects of
architecture are <span class='sc'>Order</span> (Vol. 20, p. 176),
<span class='sc'>Capital</span> (Vol. 5, p. 275), and <span class='sc'>House</span> (Vol.
13, p. 810), with its exquisite full page
plates.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Design and Mural Painting</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Design</span> (Vol. 8, p. 95), by
W. R. Lethaby, principal of the Central
School of Arts and Crafts, London, contains
a passage which
the decorator may
well bear in mind
when he has to contend
against the typical
client’s unreasoning demand for the
sensationalism which, for the moment, is
accepted as an evidence of originality,
but is always the cause of subsequent
dissatisfaction and complaint. “Modern
use has tended to associate design with
the word ‘original’ in the sense of new or
abnormal. The end of design, however,
is properly utility, fitness and delight.
<i>If a discovery, it should be a discovery of
what seems inevitable</i>, an inspiration arising
out of the conditions, and parallel to
invention in the sciences.” These fifty
words are but a millionth part of the contents
of the Britannica; but alone they
show that the work can practically serve
the designer. <span class='sc'>Mural Decoration</span> (Vol.
19, p. 16), with its delightful reproduction
in colour of a wall painting preserved
in the National Museum at Rome, and its
other illustrations, is by William Morris
and Walter Crane, with a section on
classical wall paintings by Prof. J. H.
Middleton, Slade professor of fine art at
Cambridge University. The “furnishing”
point of view is considered under other
headings (see below). Here the distinguished
contributors give an interesting
account of marble and stone reliefs, the
oldest method of wall decoration; marble
veneer, especially appropriate to 14th
and 15th century Italian style; wall-linings
of glazed brick or tiles; coverings
of hard stucco; the recently revived
sgraffito method; stamped leather, much
used in rooms of the 16th–18th century
period; painted cloth; printed hangings
and wall-papers, of great antiquity among
the Hindus and Chinese but not common
in Europe until the 18th century; wall-painting,
with description of the characteristic
schemes of mural art in ancient
and modern times, and methods of execution.</p>

<p class='c007'>In further connection with this subject
the reader should turn to <span class='sc'>Egypt</span>, <i>Art and
Archaeology</i> (Vol. 9, p. 65), by the noted
Egyptologist, W. M. Flinders Petrie;

Gardner; <span class='sc'>Roman Art</span> (Vol. 23, p. 474),

459), by Prof. G. B. Brown, of Edinburgh
University, and other authorities;
<span class='sc'>Sculpture</span> (Vol. 24, p. 488), by Professor
Middleton and other authorities; <span class='sc'>Mosaic</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 883), by Professor Middleton
and H. Stuart Jones, with a practical section
on <i>Modern Mosaic</i> (p. 888), by Sir
William Blake Richmond, noted for his
accomplishments in decorative art. All
of these articles are richly illustrated.

<i>Painting</i> and <i>Sculpture</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Wall and the Floor</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Wall-Coverings</span> (Vol. 28, p. 279), by
James Bartlett, of Kings College, London,
deals with the subject in its practical
relation to
house furnishing,
with reference to the
conditions of the
room, the use to which it is to be put, its
lighting aspect, and its outlook. There
is much information about the employment
of marble, mosaic, tiles, metal
sheeting, tapestry, and wall-papers; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>separate articles will be found on the following
materials: <span class='sc'>Marble</span> (Vol. 17, p.
676), by J. S. Flett; <span class='sc'>Tile</span>, <i>Wall and Floor</i>
(Vol. 26, p. 971), illustrated, by William
Burton; <span class='sc'>Leather</span> (Vol. 16, p. 330), illustrated,
by Dr. J. G. Parker; <span class='sc'>Tapestry</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 403), by A. S. Cole, an admirable
historical account, fully illustrated,
and giving information on varieties
of design, indications of date, the
marks of makers, modern tapestry weaving,
etc. <span class='sc'>Bayeux Tapestry</span> (Vol. 3, p.
555) is an interesting historical account
by the antiquarian, J. H. Round, of this
venerable relic executed by order of the
half-brother of William the Conqueror;
it is illustrated with two plates containing
11 views of the tapestry.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the matter of Floor-coverings there
are the articles <span class='sc'>Floor-Cloth</span> (Vol. 10, p.
527), <span class='sc'>Parquetry</span> (Vol. 20, p. 861), and
<span class='sc'>Carpet</span> (Vol. 5, p. 392), illustrated, by
A. S. Cole, devoted to descriptions of
carpets and rugs as designed and manufactured
in Europe and Oriental countries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Furniture</div>

<p class='c007'>The next group of topics begins with
the article <span class='sc'>Furniture</span> (Vol. 11, p. 363)
with 36 illustrations by J. G. Penderel-Brodhurst.
The
classified Table of
Articles in the Britannica
(Vol. 29, p. 888) indicates over
75 articles on separate pieces of furniture,
but in this general treatise we have
a concise history, describing periods and
styles, with many interesting facts about
the origin and use of different pieces of
furniture from the earliest time to the
“art nouveau” of very recent date.
Some of the noteworthy separate articles,
which have been written by Mr. Penderel-Brodhurst,
are <span class='sc'>Chair</span> (Vol. 5, p. 801);
<span class='sc'>Desk</span> (Vol. 8, p. 95); <span class='sc'>Table</span> (Vol. 26,
p. 325), and <span class='sc'>Bed</span> (Vol. 3, p. 612). See
also <span class='sc'>Marquetry</span> (Vol. 17, p. 751).
For those who wish to preserve unity
of style in furnishing a room, these
articles will prove of the highest value.
A full list is appended to this chapter;
and the reader should consult the chapter
in this Guide <i>For the Manufacturer of
Furniture</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Textile Fabrics</div>

<p class='c007'>The decorator and designer must be
familiar with all manner of fabrics, and
the Britannica contains an immense
fund of information
in regard to the nature,
manufacture
and use of textiles.
For purposes of study a beginning would
perhaps here be made with the article
Weaving, which is in two parts. The
first, <i>Industrial Technicology and Machinery</i>
(Vol. 28, p. 440) with 28 illustrations,
is by T. W. Fox, professor of
textiles in the University of Manchester.
Very useful will be found the classification
of weaving schemes into groups,
from which we learn the distinctive
weaves of plain cloth, twills, satins,
damasks, compound cloths, repps, piled
fabrics, chenille, velvets and plushes,
gauze, etc. All weaving machinery is
described. The second part, <i>Archaeology
and Art</i>, is written by A. S. Cole.
It is a most interesting and valuable
account of the origin of various textiles,
and the periods to which they are appropriate.
There are many illustrations
of typical designs of silk, brocade and
flax weavings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The investigation of woven fabrics
reveals the fact that the almost endless
variety of effects obtained is due in part
only to the method of weaving. Consequently,
it is necessary for the student,
in order to acquire an expert knowledge
of the character and effect on any textile
product which he wishes to employ,
to have access to the information in the
articles <span class='sc'>Bleaching</span> (Vol. 4, p. 49) illustrated;
<span class='sc'>Mercerizing</span> (Vol. 18, p. 150);
<span class='sc'>Dyeing</span> (Vol. 8, p. 744) illustrated, and
with an elaborate classification of colouring
matters—acid, direct, and developed
colours; <span class='sc'>Finishing</span> (Vol. 10, p. 378)
illustrated, and <span class='sc'>Textile Printing</span> (Vol.
26, p. 694), illustrated. The fact that this
fine series of articles has been prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>by Dr. Edmund Knecht, professor of
technological chemistry, University of
Manchester, assisted by noted authorities
like the late J. J. Hummel, professor
of dyeing, University of Leeds, and A. S.
Cole, is a guarantee of their great interest
and value.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the matter of the fabrics themselves,
under <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, <i>Cotton Goods and Yarn</i>
(Vol. 7, p. 275) will be found descriptions
of many cotton fabrics, and see
also <span class='sc'>Silk</span> (Vol. 25, p. 96) illustrated, by
Arthur Mellor and other authorities;
<span class='sc'>Wool, Worsted, and Woolen Manufactures</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 805) illustrated,
by Prof. A. F. Barker of Bradford Technical
College; <span class='sc'>Linen and Linen Manufactures</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 724) by Thomas
Woodhouse, head of the weaving and
textile designing department, Technical
College, Dundee. Those who desire a
closer scientific knowledge of fibres may
obtain it from <span class='sc'>Fibres</span> (Vol. 10, p. 309),
illustrated, by the well-known English
analytical chemist, C. F. Cross. There
are separate articles on <span class='sc'>Brocade</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 620); <span class='sc'>Muslin</span> (Vol. 19, p. 93); <span class='sc'>Canvas</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 223); <span class='sc'>Chintz</span> (Vol. 6, p. 235);
<span class='sc'>Cretonne</span> (Vol. 7, p. 431); <span class='sc'>Gauze</span> (Vol.
11, p. 357) and other textiles. A full
list of these materials is appended.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Lace</span> (Vol. 16, p. 37) is
one of the most notable contributions
to the Britannica. It is written by A.
S. Cole, author of <i>Embroidery and Lace</i>,
<i>Ancient Needle Point and Pillow Lace</i>,
etc., and has over 60 illustrations. A
full history of lacemaking is given, and
the article is of the highest interest
throughout. There exists no better manual
on the subject than this, and the
pictures alone will enable the student
to distinguish the different varieties.
<span class='sc'>Embroidery</span> (Vol. 9, p. 309) by A. F.
Kendrick, keeper of the Victoria and
Albert Museum, and A. S. Cole, has 18
illustrations and describes the characteristics
of the art as practised by different
nationalities. <span class='sc'>Gold and Silver
Thread</span> (Vol. 12, p. 200), also by A. S.
Cole, is a general and historical account
of the gold and silver strips, threads and
gimp used in connection with varieties
of weaving, embroidery and twisting and
with plaiting or lace-work.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arts and Crafts</div>

<p class='c007'>Before taking up the specific objects
of art used in interior decoration and
furnishing, attention must be called to
the many articles of
great value to those
engaged in all arts
and crafts-work
whose success depends upon a sound
knowledge of methods and the principle
of design. In <span class='sc'>Arts and Crafts</span> (Vol. 2,
p. 700) Mr. Walter Crane gives an account
of the recent movement in the arts of
decorative design and handicraft that
has for its object the adornment of the
house. Handicraft workers will find
valuable material, discussing designs,
methods and tools, in <span class='sc'>Needlework</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 339); <span class='sc'>Wood-carving</span> (Vol. 28,
p. 791) fully illustrated, by F. A. Crallan,
author of <i>Gothic Wood-carving</i>; <span class='sc'>Carving
and Gilding</span> (Vol. 5, p. 438); <span class='sc'>Metal-Work</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 205) illustrated, by

for the City of London Guilds and Institute;
<span class='sc'>Embossing</span> (Vol. 9, p. 308);
<span class='sc'>Chasing</span> (Vol. 5, p. 956); <span class='sc'>Repoussé</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 108); <span class='sc'>Enamel</span> (Vol. 9, p.
362) a very complete historical and
technical article, fully illustrated, by

Enamelling on Metals</i>; <span class='sc'>Japan</span>, <i>Cloisonné
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Enamel</i> (Vol. 15, p. 189); <span class='sc'>Inlaying</span> (Vol.
14, p. 574). Much knowledge about primitive
shapes and designs may be obtained
from <span class='sc'>Archaeology</span> (Vol. 2, p. 344) by
Dr. Charles H. Read of the British
Museum, <span class='sc'>Aegean Civilization</span> (Vol. 1,
p. 245) by D. G. Hogarth, the explorer,

287), and <span class='sc'>America</span>, <i>Archaeology</i> (Vol. 1,
p. 810) by the late O. T. Mason, of the
National Museum, Washington. These
articles are beautifully illustrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Portable Ornaments</div>

<p class='c007'>Some of the articles on art objects
have already been mentioned; in addition
to them there is <span class='sc'>Ceramics</span> (Vol. 5,
p. 703), equivalent
to 133 pages of this
Guide, with over 100
illustrations including
10 full-page plates, six of which are
colour. This magnificent article is the
joint contribution of six special authorities
and describes the art of pottery and
porcelain manufacture, potter’s marks,
etc., in all countries and at all periods,
with the exception of Japanese ceramics,
for which see <span class='sc'>Japan</span>, <i>Art</i>, <i>Ceramics</i> (Vol.
15, p. 183). <span class='sc'>Glass</span> (Vol. 12, p. 86) has
a section on the <i>History of Glass Manufacture</i>
(p. 97) in which glassware from
the primitive vessels of ancient Egypt
to modern wares is discussed and illustrated.
The authors of this valuable
account are Alexander Nesbitt, who
wrote the descriptive catalogue of glass
vessels for the South Kensington Museum,
and H. J. Powell, of the Whitefriars
Glass Works, London. <span class='sc'>Plate</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 789) illustrated, is the joint
product of H. Stuart Jones, formerly
director of the British School at Rome;
H. R. H. Hall, of the British Museum,
and E. Alfred Jones, author of <i>Old English
Gold Plate</i>. It contains unusually
full information about hall-marks. There
are also separate articles on <span class='sc'>Pewter</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 338) and <span class='sc'>Sheffield Plate</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 824) by Malcolm Bell,
author of <i>Pewter Plate</i>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Clock</span> has a section <i>Decorative Aspects</i>
(Vol. 6, p. 552), by J. G. Penderel-Brodhurst.
<span class='sc'>Fan</span> (Vol. 10, p. 168) by the late
J. H. Pollen, author of <i>Ancient and Modern
Furniture and Woodwork</i>, devotes
special attention to styles of fan painting.
<span class='sc'>Ivory</span> has a well-illustrated section on
<i>Ivory Sculpture and the Decorative Arts</i>
(Vol. 15, p. 95) by A. O. Maskell, author
of <i>Ivories</i>, etc. <span class='sc'>Mirror</span> (Vol. 18, p. 575);
<span class='sc'>Frame</span> (Vol. 10, p. 773), and <span class='sc'>Screen</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 477) are likewise useful
articles for the decorator and furnisher.
<span class='sc'>Terracotta</span> (Vol. 26, p. 653) illustrated,
by H. B. Walters of the British Museum,
and William Burton, deals with the use
of this material in architecture and sculpture,
describes its manufacture, and contains
an historical and critical discussion
of subjects and types. <span class='sc'>Byzantine Art</span>
by W. R. Lethaby contains a section,
<i>Metal Work, Ivories, and Textiles</i> (Vol.
4, p. 910).</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject of <span class='sc'>Lacquer</span> (Vol. 16, p.
53) is further treated under <span class='sc'>Japan</span>,
<i>Lacquer</i> (Vol. 15, p. 188), a part of a very
elaborate discussion of all forms of Japanese
art, including especially <i>Painting
and Engraving</i> (Vol. 15, p. 172), which,
as well as <span class='sc'>China</span>, <i>Art</i> (Vol. 6, p. 213),
will be referred to constantly by all who
are interested in Oriental handiwork
and design.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Biographies</div>

<p class='c007'>A great number of the biographies in

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVIII<br> <span class='c014'>FOR RAILROAD MEN</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>There are no less than six distinct
classes of articles in the new
Encyclopædia Britannica which
contain information of peculiar interest
to railroad men:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Articles on continents contain authoritative
and original accounts of trans-continental
routes and traffic. For example
the article <span class='sc'>Europe</span> has a table in
which the 19 chief avenues of trade are
analyzed, showing the direct distance,
the distance by sea and the distance by
rail from point to point; another table
comparing railroad developments in the
various parts of Europe, and also an account
of the contour of Europe from the
railroad man’s point of view, discussing
the mountain ranges pierced by tunnels
and the passes over which lines have
been carried wholly or largely in the
open.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Six Classes of Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>2. The articles on separate countries,
on the individual states of the Union, and
on colonies contain detailed accounts of
the railway systems.
For example, the article
<span class='sc'>France</span> describes
the six great
French railroads, traces their lines and
explains the financial system by which
they were constructed, the concessions
granted to them by the French government,
and the extent to which direct state
ownership and management has been
adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The articles on cities show the relation
of each centre to the general railroad
system of the country and describe
the terminals and the methods of urban
communication. For example, in the
article <span class='sc'>Berlin</span> there is an account of the
Stadtbahn, carried through the heart of
the city, 20 feet above the street, providing
for through traffic as well as for suburban
service.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The maps as well as the many
plans of cities, all of which were specially
prepared for the Britannica, show much
more clearly than does an ordinary atlas,
the present development of railroads in
all parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The articles on various branches of
engineering and mechanics, described in
other chapters of this Guide, are complete
treatises on the technical subjects
connected with railroad construction and
management.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. The articles devoted exclusively to
the subject, of which a brief account is
given in the present chapter, are those to
which railroad men will naturally first
turn.</p>

<p class='c007'>The key article is <span class='sc'>Railways</span> (Vol. 22,
p. 819), equivalent in length to more than
120 pages of this Guide. It is written by
the foremost authorities on the subject
both in the Old World and in the New,
including:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Technical Authorities</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Arthur Twining Hadley</span>, president
of Yale University, and author of
<i>Railroad Transportation</i>.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Hugh Munro
Ross</span>, author of
<i>British Railways</i>
and editor of the
<i>Engineering Supplement</i> of the London
Times.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Ray Morris</span>, formerly managing
editor of the <i>Railway Age Gazette</i> of
New York and author of <i>Railroad
Administration</i>.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Lt. Col. H. A. Yorke</span>, C.B., chief
inspecting officer of railways of the
English Board of Trade.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Prof. Frank Haigh Dixon</span>, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Dartmouth College, author of <i>State

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>William Ernest Dalby</span>, professor
of engineering in the South Kensington
Central Technical College, and author
of <i>The Balancing of Engines</i>, etc.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>William Barclay Parsons</span>, formerly
chief engineer to the New York
City Rapid Transit Commission and
advisory engineer of the Royal Commission
on London Traffic.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Maj. Gen. C. E. Webber</span>, founder
of the Institute of Electrical
Engineers.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Emile Garcke</span>, managing director
of the British Electric Traction Co.,
Ltd., author of <i>Manual of Electrical
Undertakings</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Key Article</div>

<p class='c007'>The article opens with an introductory
historical summary which describes the
use of railways or tramways before the
invention of the steam locomotive
in mining districts
in England (just as
in the article <i>Mauch
Chunk</i>, Vol. 17, p. 903, early mine transportation
in America is described) and
the way in which their use induced the
development of high speed locomotives
and how the first American trans-continental
railroads were built. The student
will find next a section of general
statistics of railway mileage for the
world, with a summary of American
railway building, especially in the Far
West since 1896. The following section is
on economics and legislation in general,
followed by separate treatment of British
railway legislation and of American railway
legislation. The great problem of
government control and operation of
railways as practised in various European
countries is also discussed and is of interest
in connection with contemporary
American tendencies. The safety of
railway transportation is treated in a
section containing in compact form the
most valuable classified statistics. A
section on <i>Financial Organization</i> compares
American and British conditions in
a most illuminating way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of even greater importance to the technical
student are the remaining sections
of this great article, namely:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <span class='sc'>Construction</span>, with subsections
on <i>Location</i>, <i>Cuttings and Embankments</i>,
<i>Gradients</i>, <i>Curves</i>, <i>Gauge</i>, <i>Permanent Way</i>
(including ballast, ties, fish-plates and
other rail joints, and rails), <i>Bridges</i>,
<i>Rack</i> (or cog) <i>Railways</i>, <i>Cable Railways</i>,
<i>Mono-Rail Systems</i>, <i>Switches and Cross-overs</i>,
<i>Railway Stations</i> (for passengers
and for freight), <i>Round Houses for Locomotives</i>,
and <i>Switching Yards</i>. This treatise
on construction is equivalent to 22
pages of the type and size of this Guide,
and is in itself an adequate brief manual
for the use of the construction engineer,
with valuable illustrations in the text.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <span class='sc'>Locomotive Power</span>, including
subsections on <i>Fundamental Relations</i>,
<i>Methods of Applying Locomotive Power</i>,
<i>General Locomotive Efficiency</i>, <i>Analysis of
Train Resistance</i>, <i>Vehicle Resistance</i>, <i>Engine
Resistance</i>, <i>Maximum Boiler Power</i>,
<i>Draught</i>, <i>The Steam Engine</i>, <i>Tractive
Force</i>, <i>Engine Efficiency</i>, <i>Piston Speed</i>,
<i>Compound Locomotives</i>, <i>Balancing of Locomotives</i>,
<i>Classes of Locomotives</i>, <i>Current
Developments</i>. This section of the article
is a little longer than the preceding,—it
would fill 25 pages of this Guide,—and
has illustrations, tables, and formulae.
It is written by Prof. Dalby, the principal
British authority on locomotives.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <span class='sc'>Rolling Stock</span>, dealing with dining,
sleeping, passenger and vestibule
cars, wood and metal, their heating and
lighting and their weight and speed; with
freight cars, their weight and speed; and
with car-couplers and brakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) <span class='sc'>Intra-Urban</span>, or city street railways,
elevated and underground, by W.
B. Parsons, formerly chief engineer of
the New York Rapid Transit Commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) <span class='sc'>Light Railways</span> for rural and interurban
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>service and portable railways.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other Major Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>The next article to be read is <i>Tramway</i>
(Vol. 27, p. 159), dealing with the earliest
railways used in coal mines, American
and English, without locomotive power;
and with modern street railways,—surface
lines, steam, cable and electric, the
last being subdivided
into three classes,
overhead or trolley,
open conduit and
closed conduit. The different types of
street cars are discussed, and there are
summaries of legislation and of commercial
results, with general statistics.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Traction</span> (Vol. 27, p. 118,
equivalent to more than 20 pages of this
Guide) is by Louis Duncan, formerly
head of the department of electrical engineering
in the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. It deals principally with
electric traction and thus supplements
the article <span class='sc'>Tramway</span>. <i>Steam</i> traction, as
treated in the section on <i>Locomotive
Power</i> in the article <span class='sc'>Railways</span>, by Prof.
Dalby, may be studied further in the
article <span class='sc'>Steam-Engine</span> (Vol. 25, p. 818),
and especially that part of the article
which deals with locomotives (§ 104, p.
841).</p>

<p class='c007'>The civil engineer engaged in railway
work will profit by reading, besides the
articles already mentioned: Professor W.
C. Unwin’s article (Vol. 4, p. 533) on
<span class='sc'>Bridges</span>, especially pp. 545 and 547 seq.,
dealing with railway bridges; and the article
<span class='sc'>Tunnel</span> (Vol. 27, p. 399), by H. A.
Carson, engineer-in-charge of the Boston
Subway and of the East Boston Tunnel,
which would make about 30 pages if
printed in the form of this Guide. This
article classifies tunnels into river, mountain
and town (subway) tunnels, and
gives special information about rail corrosion
and ventilation in tunnels.</p>

<p class='c007'>The equipment engineer will add to
the topics already listed (cars, engines,
etc.) the article <span class='sc'>Signal</span>, § <i>Railway Signalling</i>
(Vol. 25, p. 73; as long as 15 pages
of this Guide), by B. B. Adams, of the
<i>Railway Age Gazette</i>, and H. M. Ross, of
the London <i>Times</i> Engineering Supplement;
and <span class='sc'>Brake</span> (Vol. 4, p. 414).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Legislation</div>

<p class='c007'>On the history of railroading and on
statistics there is much information in
the Britannica in local articles. It has
already been remarked
that each
article dealing with
a state of the United States, or any of the
commercial countries of the world, has a
section on <i>Communications</i>, giving railway
mileage and describing the principal railway
lines in the area; and that articles on
cities and towns give accurate and minute
information about railway service. In
pursuing the study of legislation bearing
on railways, and especially on rate legislation,
the student should read the article
<span class='sc'>Interstate Commerce</span> (Vol. 14, p. 711),
by Prof. Frank A. Fetter of Princeton
University, a part at least of the article
<span class='sc'>Trusts</span> (Vol. 27, p. 334), by Prof. J. W.
Jenks, of New York University (formerly
of Cornell), parts of the article on the
history of the United States, in the same
volume, especially pp. 315, 316, 353, 367,
394, 395, 396, 406, 407, and, in separate
state articles, the sections on laws and
history, notably <span class='sc'>North Carolina</span> for
the rate cases of 1907 (Vol. 19, p. 778),
<span class='sc'>Nebraska</span> for the maximum freight rate
of 1893 (Vol. 19, p. 329), <span class='sc'>Wisconsin</span> on
radical rate legislation and on physical
valuation for <i>ad valorem</i> tax of railways
(Vol. 28, p. 744).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Biographies</div>

<p class='c007'>The biographical articles in the new
Britannica also have much important information
for the student of railways.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the names of
inventors whose
lives are outlined are:
<span class='sc'>Thomas Newcomen</span> (Vol. 19, p. 475),

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIX<br> <span class='c014'>FOR MARINE TRANSPORTATION MEN</span></h3>
</div>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Problems of the Near Future</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The immediate future of marine
commerce cannot fail to be very
greatly affected by changed conditions.
No one believes that England,
Germany, France, Russia, Austria, Japan
and China will be able, before the
middle of the century, to establish a
stable adjustment of the international
difficulties which surround them. No
one knows what changes the Panama
Canal may make in the movement of
freights within the first ten years of its
operation. No one
knows to what industry
the United
States may next apply
the methods by
which the country has created the age
of steel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coal and the steam engine may both,
within a few years, be displaced as factors
in marine transportation. Sweeping
tariff changes in the United States, in
Great Britain and in Germany may vitally
affect the movement of freights.
Transatlantic passenger traffic, not only
a huge business in itself, but also important,
so long as it is sea-borne, in its
effects upon transatlantic freights, may
become aerial instead of marine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Technical Subjects</div>

<p class='c007'>Confronted by the approach of a period
so full of changes, the uttermost alertness
of outlook is merely elementary prudence
on the part of everyone engaged in the
business of marine transportation; and
the new Britannica reviews all the many
fields of knowledge which are of importance
in this connection. It supplies
technical information regarding the construction
of ships, the management of
shipping lines, marine engines of every
kind, shipboard and waterside appliances
for the handling of cargo, the development
of harbours and the dredging
and embankment of rivers, the building
of docks, warehouses and dry docks,
ship canals and canal locks, navigation,
lighthouses, lightships,
buoys, lanes
of traffic, marine insurance,
cold transport—every
conceivable subject with
which shipping men are concerned.
Articles by contributors in twenty different
countries, deal with all the world’s
ports, industries, exports, imports and
shipping. The financial and legal aspects
of the business are exhaustively
covered. Tariffs, legislation affecting
marine transportation, and such questions
of international policy as the command
of the sea, the right of search, and the
position of neutrals in wartime are discussed
by the highest authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to all this, the Britannica
articles on these and similar subjects
contain historical sections which, in conjunction
with the articles on the history
of all countries, <i>show how past changes,
as sweeping as these which are now anticipated,
have affected commerce</i>. Whether
your present position—or the position
you are endeavouring to make for yourself—in
relation to shipping is such that
this coming period of transition promises
to affect you favourably or unfavourably,
you need to be forewarned and forearmed,
prepared to keep what you have
or get what you want.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Outline of Sea Trade</div>

<p class='c007'>A course of reading should always
begin with the study of general principles,
in order that in your subsequent and
more detailed examination of the field,
the relative importance of each fact
that you master may be appreciated.
The Britannica provides, in the article
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span><span class='sc'>Commerce</span> (Vol. 6, p. 766), a bird’s-eye
view of the whole subject of marine
transportation. The
article would not fill
more than 16 pages
of this Guide; you
can read it (and digest it as you read
it, so clear is it) in an hour, and yet
it will give you such a grasp of the whole
science—for it is a science—of international
trade that you will spend another
hour in assorting and classifying, in your
own mind, a mass of impressions you had
received before, at school or in the course
of casual reading, impressions which have
not been so useful to you as they should
have been because they had not been
systematically arranged. There is no
text book in existence which outlines the
subject so fully and clearly as does this
one brief article—about one five-thousandth
part of the total contents of the
Britannica.</p>

<p class='c007'>This article will arouse your interest
in the direct relation between commerce,
past, present and future, and the progress
of civilization. You will realize
that the man who has any part in the
vast shifting of cargoes from one part of
the world to another is distributing
ideas and ideals and ambitions as well
as commodities, and in the article <span class='sc'>Civilization</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 403), by Dr. Henry
Smith Williams, editor of <i>The Historians’
History of the World</i>, you will see how
harbours receive and send on to the inlands
the influences as well as the manufactures
of the more advanced communities.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these articles you should turn
to the three great articles which deal
with the methods by which these wonderful
results are accomplished. These
three are <span class='sc'>Ship</span>, <span class='sc'>Shipbuilding</span> and <span class='sc'>Shipping</span>,
all in volume 24, and equivalent to
about 420 or 425 pages of this Guide.
These three articles contain hundreds of
illustrations, more than forty being full
page plates. They are by the most
eminent authorities. Sir Philip Watts,
director of naval construction for the
British Navy, designer of the Dreadnoughts
and the Super-Dreadnoughts of
the British Navy, as well as of the “Mauretania”
and the “Lusitania,” chairman
of the Federation of Shipbuilders, and
naval architect and director of the warshipbuilding
department of Armstrong,
Whitworth &#38; Co., Ltd., wrote the articles
<span class='sc'>Shipbuilding</span> and <span class='sc'>Ship</span> (except the
history of ships before the invention of
steamships, which is by Edmund Warre,
provost of Eton, well-known as a writer
on nautical history). The article <span class='sc'>Shipping</span>
is by Douglas Owen, lecturer at the
Royal Naval War College and author
of <i>Ports and Docks</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In brief, these three articles in length,
contents,—both text and illustrations,—and
authorship, make up a remarkable
book on the subject, valuable either as a
text-book or a work of reference for the
ship builder, the marine engineer or the
student of shipping.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Story of the Ship</div>

<p class='c007'>Taking the articles separately, the
article <span class='sc'>Ship</span> begins with a section of
nearly 10,000 words on the early development
of ships. It suggests
that shells floating on the
water or the nautilus may
first have suggested the use
of a hollowed tree-trunk for transportation—the
first boat or “ship” (the word
comes from the same root as “scoop”)
as distinct from a raft. The evolution of
boat building is traced,—from dug-out
to bark- or skin-covered frame, built
like modern racing-shells sometimes ribs
first and then skin laid on and sometimes
shell first and then ribs inserted. In
spite of the great length of the period
during which such boats were used—of
course they are still used by more
primitive peoples,—it is interesting to
notice that there were local variations
which never became general, such as the
outrigger and weather platform, used in
the South Pacific and not found elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Egyptian vessels we may study in the
excellent early tomb-paintings still preserved,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and one of these shows a ship,
not a canoe or large boat, such as was in
use from 3000–1000 B. C., fitted with
oars and a mast in two pieces which could
be lowered and laid along a high spardeck.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Phoenicians did more than the
Egyptians to develop ship and navigation,
and a Phoenician galley of the 8th
century B. C. is shown in an Assyrian
wall painting. The Phoenicians probably
sailed out of the Mediterranean, to
Britain for tin, or even around Africa.</p>

<p class='c007'>Greek ships and shipbuilding we know
from a full and varied national literature,
from the figures on coins and vases, and
from the discovery in 1834 at the Peiraeus,
the port of Athens, of records of Athenian
dockyard superintendents for several
years between 373 and 324 B.C. We
have besides descriptions, partly technical,
showing the point of view of the
engineer or architect, written by Roman
authors. The article gives a critical
account of the Greek types of vessels.
The growth of Roman shipping seems
to have been due primarily to political
reasons and to have advanced slowly
but surely,—practical devices being introduced
to solve special difficulties in a
field and on an element where the Romans
were far from being at home. A five-tiered
Carthaginian galley which had
drifted ashore served the Romans as a
model for their first war-ship, and with
crews taught to row in a framework
set up on dry land they manned a fleet
which was launched in sixty days from
the time that the trees were felled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mast and Sail</div>

<p class='c007'>Passing quickly over the remainder of
the earlier period, which the reader will
find treated in full in the article <span class='sc'>Ship</span>,
he should notice that
the sailing vessel
came into use gradually
for merchant use, but that galleys
(propelled by oars) were long the only
type for warships. There were some
galleys even in the Spanish Armada of
1588. In the meantime the invention
of gunpowder and the development of
artillery brought about changes in size
and in form, with a notable tendency
to more masts and a greater spread of
sail. The discoveries of the 15th and
16th centuries and especially the consequent
expansion of trade in the 17th
century, all tended to increase the size
and efficiency of sailing ships. The
end of the 18th and the beginning of the
19th century marked the highest point
in the development of American sailing
ships. “The Americans with their fast-sailing
‘clippers’ taught the English
builders a lesson, showing that increased
length in proportion to beam gave
greater speed, while permitting the use
of lighter rigging in proportion to tonnage,
and the employment of smaller crews. The
English shipyards were for a long time
unequal to the task of producing vessels
capable of competing with those of their
American rivals, and their trade suffered
accordingly. But after the repeal of the
Navigation Laws in 1850, things improved
and we find clippers from Aberdeen and
the Clyde beginning to hold their own
on the long voyages to China and elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The revolution in marine transportation
by the introduction of steam is
summed up by Sir Philip Watts as
follows:</p>

<p class='c020'>Before steam was applied to the propulsion
of ships, the voyage from Great Britain
to America lasted for some weeks; at
the beginning of the 20th century the
time had been reduced to about six days,
and in 1910 the fastest vessels could do it
in four and a half days. Similarly, the voyage
to Australia, which took about thirteen
weeks, had been reduced to thirty days or
less. The fastest of the sailing tea-clippers
required about three months to bring the
early teas from China to Great Britain; in
1910 they were brought to London by the
ordinary P. &#38; O. service in five weeks. Atlantic
liners now run between England and
America which maintain speeds of 25 and
26 knots over the whole course, as compared
with about 12 knots before the introduction
of steam.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Iron Hulls</div>

<p class='c007'>The introduction of iron for wood
began about the same time as the substitution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>of steam for sails, and there was
even more prejudice
against it. This was
due not merely to
the sentiment attaching to the oaken
timbers that typified “hearts of oak,”
or to the “Wooden Walls of England.”
In all seriousness it was objected that
iron would not float! It was feared
that iron bottoms would be more easily
perforated when ships grounded; but
this was found not to be the case when
construction was careful. It was proved
that fouling of iron bottoms from weeds
and barnacles might be remedied by
frequent cleaning and repainting. The
most serious objection against iron was
that it affected the compass; but in 1839
Sir G. B. Airy laid down rules for the
correction of compass errors due to iron
in construction. But even to-day wood is
preferred for the construction of ships
for scientific expeditions to the Polar
regions where the slightest disturbance
of the compass is to be avoided. Iron
and steel (first used in shipbuilding to
any extent in 1870–75) have three advantages
over wooden ships: less weight;
greater durability; greater ease in securing
the necessary general and local
strengths. But while iron was coming
into use largely because it is more durable,
there was a great increase in the
durability of wooden ships, due to the
improved knowledge of wood-preservation.
At the end of the 18th century
15 or 20 years was the average life of
a wooden ship; but there are several
instances of ships built in the first decade
of the 19th century—or even earlier—which
were still in commission at the beginning
of the 20th century.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Early Steamships</div>

<p class='c007'>Full details are given in regard to the
first ships used for canal and river navigation
in Great Britain and the United
States; the comparatively rapid adoption
of steam vessels on the Irish and
English channels; and the first steamships
to make long trips—the American-built
“Savannah” which crossed the Atlantic
in 1819 in 25 days using steam only
a part of the time,
the “Enterprise”
which went from
London to Calcutta
in 1825 in 103 days (64 under steam), the
“Sirius,” the “Great Western,” etc.
All these were propelled by paddle-wheels.
Jet propulsion had been suggested by
Benjamin Franklin in 1775 and was tried
several times with some success. But
the greater success of the screw-propeller,
perfected by Colonel John Stevens and
Captain John Ericsson, soon caused jet-propulsion
to be abandoned. The screw-propeller
made possible—and was quickly
followed by—great improvements in
engines; the gearing used with paddles
was soon given up for direct-acting engines—compound
about 1854, triple-expansion
in 1874.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>History of Shipping</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Shipping</span> (Vol. 24, p. 983)
is devoted to the history and practice
of maritime transportation. It outlines
the early period of
trade, and the contest
for trade among
Spain, Portugal, the
Netherlands and England, especially in
the period after the discovery of America,
when the prizes of commerce became
suddenly so much richer. The Navigation
Act of 1651, confining the trade
between England and her colonies and
the British coasting trade to English
ships, was followed by a rapid growth
of English shipping. The tonnage
doubled between 1666 and 1688. In the
18th century and into the 19th, the
history of shipping was primarily a
contest for trade between France and
England, finally won by the latter. The
19th century, as has already been seen
in the article <span class='sc'>Ship</span>, was marked by the
adoption of steam as a motive power.
The struggle for supremacy in the Atlantic
trade and in commerce with China
and the Far East between the United
States and Great Britain was won by the
latter largely for this reason—the American
ship-builders clung to the sailing
clipper too long—and they were too
slow in adopting iron instead of wooden
hulls. The American Civil War was an
additional set-back to American commerce.
Other great factors during the
last 50 years in the development of shipping,
treated in the article, may be catalogued
here:</p>

<p class='c020'>The opening of the Suez Canal in
1869.</p>

<p class='c020'>Improved apparatus for fire prevention.</p>

<p class='c020'>Refrigerating machinery, making

and other foods.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>What “Engineering” Includes</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The history of a word will sometimes
supply the key to the
gradual development of an art.
“Engineering” was originally used to
describe a mere branch of military
science, the construction of fortifications
and the trenching and sapping
needed for their capture. Then
about a century and a half ago the use
of the phrase “civil engineering” came
into use to indicate the broadening of
the engineer’s functions to civil pursuits,
but even then it served for a long time
chiefly to describe surveying, road-making
and bridge building. To-day, the
specialized knowledge of engineers of one
kind or another directs or facilitates
every branch of industry. Consider for
a moment the handling of iron, which,
as the Britannica article <span class='sc'>Iron and Steel</span>
shows, has become the most indispensable
of all substances save air and water,
because we can find
no substitute for it
that possesses its
strength, the hardness
and the pliability
we can give to it, and its magnetic
properties, upon which all our
electrical work depends. The mining
engineer is concerned with the ore, the
mechanical engineer with the machinery
employed in its treatment; the transportation
of the finished iron or steel
depends upon the skill of the engineers
who construct railroads and ships; the
structural engineer shapes our buildings
from the girders and erects them on the
sites indicated by the surveying engineer;
the sanitary engineer makes them
wholesome, and the electrical engineer
provides them with the many convenient
appliances we need. Various primitive
races have believed that the earth is
supported upon the back of a tortoise,
an elephant, or a fish; but when we
begin to look into the origin of the surroundings
we have made for ourselves,
we cannot carry our examination very
far before we find that almost everything
we possess begins with a blueprint.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems a paradox, and yet it is true,
that the more a man’s profession tends
to specialization, the more help he can
get from the comprehensiveness of the
Britannica. He finds it necessary to dig
so deep that the shaft he sinks must
perforce be of narrow diameter, limiting
his daily vision to but a small circle of
the broad sky above him. The engineer
of each class has his own text books, but
at any moment his work may bring him
into temporary relation with allied subjects
which they do not cover, and in
connection with which he may need
trustworthy information. There is certainly
no other book which surveys so
authoritatively and minutely as does the
Britannica the whole field of applied science.
The services rendered by the 73
engineering experts—German, American,
English, French and Italian—who
collaborated in the production of the
work are not to be measured only by the
articles they wrote; for the advice and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>assistance many of them gave the editors
in planning the book as a whole, ensured
such treatment as an engineer
would desire of many subjects indirectly
connected with his work.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Canal</span> (Vol. 5, p. 168), by Sir E.
Leader Williams, chief engineer of Manchester
Ship Canal during construction,
is an interesting article. There are also
separate articles on great engineering
undertakings, such as <span class='sc'>Panama Canal</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 667); <span class='sc'>Manchester Ship
Canal</span> (Vol. 17, p. 550) by Sir E. Leader
Williams; <span class='sc'>Suez Canal</span> (Vol. 26, p. 22).
It will surprise many readers to learn
that the project of a ship canal across
Central America was considered as early
as 1550, when a book demonstrating its
feasibility was published in Portugal.

<div class='sidenote'>Biographies of Engineers</div>

<p class='c007'>Military men are familiar with the
lives and deeds of great soldiers; lovers of
art and literature know something of the
careers of their favorites;
but as a rule
the engineer knows
little or nothing
about the lives of the great ornaments of
his profession, the splendid heroes of
peace who have done much more than
the soldier and the artist to create the
world of to-day. The reason for this is
that engineering biographies are very
scarce, and in this connection the new
Britannica <i>fills a positive gap</i> in the engineer’s
library. There are considerably
more than 100 biographies of great engineers,
living and dead, written in the

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>“An author, even an immortal
genius, is, from the economic
point of view, a producer of
raw material,” says the Britannica article
<span class='sc'>Publishing</span>, and from the educational
point of view, his product, until it has
undergone the industrial and commercial
processes of reduplication and distribution,
is as undeveloped as the seed lying
hidden in the winter soil. The history
of civilization might, indeed, be divided
into four stages: the period before writing;
the period before printing, when libraries
of manuscripts were almost exclusively
the property of kings and priests; the
period of costly, hand-printed books;
and the period of the power-press, which
began less than a hundred years ago.
Of these four periods, the first is almost
unimaginable. You are sometimes
brought into contact with absolutely
illiterate people. But they live in shadow,
not in total darkness; they get the diffused
light of our age of culture. The
second period, the
era of books in manuscript
we can, however,
to some extent
reconstruct; and by one fantastic supposition
we can even bring it into the
focus of our 20th century. Let it be
assumed that for some reason the printing
of the new Britannica had been enjoined
by the law courts, but that the
original typoscript was available for
consultation—say in a public library at
New York or Chicago. Instead of your
29 volumes, weighing only 80 lbs. and
occupying only about two cubic feet of
space, the walls of a large room would be
lined with partitioned shelves on which
the 300,000 typed sheets and the 7,000
illustrations, on cardboard, would be
ranged. What a mob of students there
would be, waiting their turns to read the
40,000 articles, what a mass of notebooks
would be filled each day! The
impossibility of accomplishing, without
the use of printing, all that the Britannica
does, will present itself very forcibly to
your mind, in another aspect, if you try
to imagine 1,500 separate audiences,
assembled each day to listen to lectures
by the 1,500 contributors to the book.
Any attempt to imagine the Britannica
doing its work in any way but the way
in which it does makes you realize, too,
that if it were not for modern methods
of <i>spreading</i> knowledge,
there would
be no such system
of <i>assembling</i> and
co-ordinating knowledge
as finds its fullest development in
the Britannica. It is not only for
commercial reasons that the demand
must be sufficient to justify the supply;
the 1,500 specialists who laid
aside their usual work in order to
write these articles would never have
combined their efforts if this vast public

<p class='c007'>The industrial arts which make it
possible to produce books swiftly and to
sell them at low prices are obviously
subjects of interest not only to those
who do the producing and selling, but
to all who profit by the use of books.
And, as the articles mentioned in this
chapter show, these arts are in themselves
among the most ingenious and
curious of all processes; so that in a
double sense they merit the attention
of everyone to whom the chapters on
<i>Literature</i> in this Guide would appeal.
As the warp of cloth carries the weft, so
the raw material of printers’ paper and

of the writer’s thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article on <span class='sc'>Paper</span> (Vol. 20, p. 725)
is equivalent to 35 pages of this Guide
and is illustrated with 15 diagrams.
The article is divided into three parts:
<i>History</i>, by Sir Edward Maunde Thompson,
director of the British Museum;
<i>Manufacture</i>, by J. W. Wyatt, author
of <i>The Art of Making Paper</i>; and <i>India
Paper</i>, by W. E. Garrett Fisher.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>History of Paper</div>

<p class='c007'>The history of paper, like that of so
many other great inventions, dates back
to an early period in China; and, as is
the case with almost
every great contribution
to civilization
which came
from China, paper came to the Western
world only after many years and only
by chance. In the 8th century of the
Christian era, when paper had been made
in China for 1000 years, some Chinese
paper-makers were taken captives in
Samarkand by Arabs, who thus learned
the methods of its manufacture. The
Arabs and the Persians used linen as a
base for the paper instead of the cotton
the Chinese used; and the name “paper”
was transferred from the Egyptian rush
and the writing material made from its
fibres to the new product. Paper was
manufactured in Europe first by the
Moors in Spain at Xativa, Valencia and
Toledo in the 12th century; and into
Italy also it seems to have been brought
by the Arab occupation of Sicily.
Among other interesting points in regard
to the history of paper are: water-marks
as a sign of age; old papers; variation in
prices of paper; blotting-paper, wrapping
paper, etc. The articles <span class='sc'>Papyrus</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 743) and <span class='sc'>Parchment</span> (Vol.
20, p. 798), both by Maunde Thompson,
deal with these earlier writing materials.
<span class='sc'>Palimpsest</span> (Vol. 20, p. 633) describes
the processes by which writings which
have been scraped or washed from sheets
of vellum, so that the material might be
used again, can sometimes be chemically
restored and deciphered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Paper Manufacture</div>

<p class='c007'>In taking up the study of paper manufacture,
the first article to be read is
<span class='sc'>Fibres</span> by C. F. Cross, the well-known
analytical and consulting
chemist, and
especially the section
in it on <i>Paper-making</i>
(Vol. 10, p. 312). This describes the
treatment of cotton and flax for writing
and drawing papers, wood pulp, esparto,
cellulose and cereal straws for printing-paper,
etc. See also the article <span class='sc'>Cellulose</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 606) by C. F. Cross.
The section on <i>Manufacture</i> in the article
<span class='sc'>Paper</span>, already mentioned, should next
be read. Here it is stated that rags,
linen or cotton, were the principal materials
used for paper in Europe until
the middle of the 19th century; and then
when prices rose, because the necessarily
inelastic supply was no longer sufficient,
esparto-grass, wood and straw began
to be used as substitutes. The change
from hand-making to machinery began
in France in 1798 and was accomplished
in England in 1803, with the result that
hand-made paper is now used only where
great durability is the chief requisite,
as for bank-notes and drawing paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Actual paper manufacture may be
divided into two processes: the preliminary
cleaning and reduction to pulp; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the methods of converting pulp to paper—including
beating, sizing, colouring,
making the sheet or web, surfacing,
cutting, etc. Reduction to pulp is described
in the treatment of esparto,
straw and wood, and there are cuts
showing rag-boiler, rag-breaking engine,
esparto boiler, press-pâte or half-stuff
machine, esparto bleaching and beating
plant, and the Porion evaporator and
the Yaryan multiple-effect evaporator
for soda recovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paper-making proper, after the pulp
has been prepared, is next described.
The first process is beating; and besides
the esparto bleaching and beating plant,
described under bleaching, there are
drawings of the Taylor and Jordan
beaters and a description of them and of
the Kingsland beater. Sizing, loading
and colouring are then explained. The
other main topics of the section on manufacture
are: hand manufacture (with
two illustrations), paper machine, with
pictures of the paper machine, of the
dandy roll, of super-calender and of
reel paper cutters, and paragraphs on
straining, forming the sheet, shake,
water marking and couching, pressing
and drying, surfacing, machine power,
tub-sizing, glazing or surfacing for better
grades, cutting, sheeting, sizes (with
table), standards of quality, the paper
trade, and a list of the best books on
paper.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>India Paper</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Paper</span> closes with a brief
history and description of India paper,
which is of particular interest because
of the adoption and
successful use of this
paper in the new
Encyclopaedia Britannica. In this true
India paper, “the material used is
chiefly rag,” but “the extraordinary
properties of this paper are due to the
peculiar care necessary in the treatment
of the fibres, which are specially beaten
in the beating engine.” The first India
paper was brought to England from
the Far East in 1841 by an Oxford graduate,
and the name India was used merely
to express this Oriental origin, as in
“Indian ink” or in the name “Indians”
as applied to the American aborigines
when their home was thought to be a
part of the East. Just where the paper
came from is not known. It was given
to the Oxford University Press and was
used in printing a very small English
Bible in 1842. This book was only one-third
the usual thickness, and attracted
much attention by its lightness and by
the opacity of the thin tough paper.</p>

<p class='c020'>In 1874 a copy of this Bible fell into the
hands of Henry Frowde, and experiments were
instituted at the Oxford University paper
mills at Wolvercote with the object of producing
similar paper. On the 24th of August
1875 an impression of the Bible, similar in all
respects to that of 1842, was placed on sale
by the Oxford University Press. The feat of
compression was regarded as astounding, the
demand was enormous, and in a very short
time 250,000 copies of this “Oxford India
paper Bible” had been sold. Many other editions
of the Bible, besides other books, were
printed on the Oxford India paper, and the
marvels of compression accomplished by its
use created great interest at the Paris Exhibition
of 1900. Its strength was as remarkable
as its lightness; volumes of 1500 pages
were suspended for several months by a single
leaf, as thin as tissue; and, when they were
examined at the close of the exhibition, it was
found that the leaf had not started, the paper
had not stretched, and the volume closed as
well as ever. The paper, when subjected to
severe rubbing, instead of breaking into holes
like ordinary printing paper, assumed a texture
resembling chamois leather, and a strip
3 in. wide was found able to support a weight
of 28 lb. without yielding. The success of
the Oxford India paper led to similar experiments
by other manufacturers, and there were,
in 1910, nine mills (two each in England, Germany
and Italy, one each in France, Holland
and Belgium) in which India paper was being
produced. India paper is mostly made upon
a Fourdrinier machine in continuous lengths,
in contradistinction to a hand-made paper,
which cannot be made of a greater size than
the frame employed in its production.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to technical information
in regard to paper the student of the
manufacture of books must know something
about ink.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ink</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The necessary information he will find
in the article <span class='sc'>Ink</span> (Vol. 14, p. 571) with
special descriptions of writing inks,
tannin inks, China or Indian
ink, logwood ink, aniline ink,
copying ink, red and blue ink,
marking ink, gold and silver inks, indelible
or incorrodible ink, sympathetic
ink, and, of the most importance for our
present purpose, printing inks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The process of putting ink on paper
is a subject which in the Britannica
takes much more ink and paper than the
subject of ink or of paper.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Printing</div>

<p class='c007'>This topic is treated in two main
articles: one dealing with type and the
other with presses. The former, <span class='sc'>Typography</span>
(Vol. 27, p.
509), is a good sized
treatise in itself, being
equivalent to more than 135 pages
of this Guide. It is divided into two
parts: <i>The History of Typography</i>, by
John Henry Hessels, author of <i>Gutenberg:
an Historical Investigation</i>; and <i>Modern
Practical Typography</i>, by John Southward,
author of <i>A Dictionary of Typography
and its Accessory Arts</i>, and Hugh
Munro Ross, editor of <i>The</i> (London)
<i>Times Engineering Supplement</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The former part of the article, and the
longer, is a very important and elaborate
contribution to the knowledge of early
printing. On these first developments
the student should read the same writer’s
article <span class='sc'>Gutenberg</span> (Vol. 12, p. 739) and
should notice the great difficulty surrounding
the whole question of the
“invention,” obscured by the fact that
so many of the documents on Gutenberg
exist only in copies, while others seem
to be forgeries by two librarians of the
city of Mainz who were eager to prove
the claims of their fellow citizen Gutenberg
to be the inventor of printing with
movable metal types. See also Mr.
Hessel’s article on <span class='sc'>Johann Fust</span> (Vol. 11,
p. 373). The honour of the invention of
typography, Mr. Hessels decides, belongs
to Lorens Janszoon Coster of
Haarlem and its date was somewhere
between 1440 and 1446. In Mexico
printing was established in 1544, in Manila
in 1590, and in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
in 1638 or 1639. The early
printers had only a few types of each
character in a fount, and they printed
books, even small quartos, page by page.</p>

<p class='c007'>This whole treatment of the history
of typography is too elaborate  to be
summarized here, but it is interesting
to note that the article gives information
about the history of the earliest types—Gothic,
Bastard Italian, Roman, Burgundian,
etc., with fac-similes of 13
different and characteristic faces between
1445 and 1479; and of different styles
and alphabets—Italic, Greek, Hebrew,
Arabic, Syriac, Armenian, Ethiopic, Coptic,
Samaritan, Slavonic, Russian, Etruscan,
Runic, Gothic, Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon,
Irish, Music, Characters for the
Blind, Initials, Ornaments and Flowers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Practical Typography</div>

<p class='c007'>The second part of the article <span class='sc'>Typography</span>,
on <i>Modern Practical Typography</i>,
will be of more value,
probably, to most
students of printing
and book-making.
It deals with the following topics:—</p>

<p class='c020'>Material characteristics of Type. Fount
may consist of 275 “sorts” or characters.
Numbers of sorts vary with different
languages—and with different styles
and writers; Dickens draws heavily on
vowels, Macaulay on consonants. Bill of
type or scheme—how computed.</p>

<p class='c020'>Logotypes or word character as distinct
from letters.</p>

<p class='c020'>Parts of a type—face, stem, serif,
beard, shoulder, shank, belly, back, counter,
nick, kern, feet, burr and batter.</p>

<p class='c020'>Species of letter—short, ascending, descending,
long, superior, inferior, fat-faced,
lean-faced, bastard.</p>

<p class='c020'>Sizes: classification by names and by
point-system.</p>

<p class='c020'>Varieties of face: Roman, sanserifs or
grotesques; black; script; old style; Caslon;

<p class='c007'>The reader should next turn to the
articles <span class='sc'>Engraving</span> (Vol. 9, p. 645),
<span class='sc'>Line-Engraving</span> (Vol. 16, p. 721),
<span class='sc'>Wood-Engraving</span> (Vol. 28, p. 798)—special

(Vol. 16, p. 785) including offset printing;
and <span class='sc'>Process</span> (Vol. 22, p. 408), for further
information in regard to “printing”
apart from (and before) actual press
work. The last-named of these articles
is by Edwin Bale, art director of Cassell
&#38; Company, Ltd.; it would occupy about
20 pages of this Guide; and it is illustrated
by a plate showing the three-colour
process. The article describes:</p>

<p class='c020'>(1)—relief processes, line blocks,
swelled gelatin process, typographic
etching, halftone processes,
three colour blocks, colour
filters;</p>

<p class='c020'>(2)—intaglio processes, monotype,

woodburytype, stannotype,
collotype or phototype, heliotype
and photolithography. In relation
to lithography there is further
information in the biographical
sketch of Senefelder, its
inventor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Press-Work</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Printing</span> (Vol. 22, p. 350)
deals entirely with the subject of press-work,
thus using printing in the narrower
and more correct
sense of the word.
In length this article
is equivalent to 25 pages of this Guide;
and it contains 9 illustrations of presses.
The article is by C. T. Jacobi, author of
<i>Printing</i>, and <i>The Printer’s Handbook of
Trade Recipes</i>. The article gives a
history of the printing press, which was
practically unchanged for a century and
a half, until the Dutch map-maker
Blaeu greatly simplified it. The first
important metal press—earlier ones were
of wood—was invented by Lord Stanhope
nearly two hundred years later. It had
greater power with smaller expenditure
of labour, and its workings, as well as
that of the Blaeu press, and of the Albion,
which was used by William Morris at
Kelmscott, may be readily understood
from the illustrations in the article.
Another hand press is the Columbian,
invented in 1816 by a Philadelphian,
George Clymer, and still in use for heavy
hand work. Power presses began to be
made at the end of the 18th century,
but the presses invented by William
Nicholson (1790) and Friedrich König
(adopted by the London <i>Times</i> in 1814)
printed only on one side at a time, as
did the “double platen” machine of a little
later date. The cylindrical eight feeder
built by Augustus Applegath in 1848 for
the London <i>Times</i> and the Hoe Type Revolving
Machine are described in the
section on the history of power presses,
which closes with the story of Bullock’s
machine (1865) for printing from a continuous
web of paper.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Modern Presses</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>The closing section of the article on
printing is devoted to a description
of modern presses.
It opens with a list of the
principal types of presses still
in use, which are classified under the following
seven heads:—</p>

<p class='c020'>(1)—iron hand-presses like the Albion
or Columbian, for proof-pulling
or limited editions;</p>

<p class='c020'>(2)—small platen machines for job or
commercial work;</p>

<p class='c020'>(3)—single cylinder machines
(“Wharfedales”) printing one
side only;</p>

<p class='c020'>(4)—perfecting machines, usually two
cylinder, printing both sides, but
with two distinct operations;</p>

<p class='c020'>(5)—two-revolution machines with one
cylinder;</p>

<p class='c020'>(6)—two-colour machines, with one
cylinder usually, but two printing
surfaces and two sets of inking
apparatus;</p>

<p class='c020'>(7)—rotary machines for printing
from curved plates upon an endless
web of paper—principally
for newspapers or periodical
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>These seven classes are next described
in detail and the article illustrates them
all. A cut of an Albion press is given in
an early part of the article, and the
other six presses shown in the cuts are:</p>

<p class='c020'>The Golding jobber platen machine</p>

<p class='c020'>Payne &#38; Sons’ Wharfedale stop-cylinder
machine</p>

<p class='c020'>Dryden &#38; Foord’s perfecting machine</p>

<p class='c020'>The Miehle two-revolution cylinder
machine</p>

<p class='c020'>Payne &#38; Sons’ two-colour single cylinder
machine</p>

<p class='c020'>Hoe’s double-octuple rotary machine</p>

<p class='c007'>The article closes with a discussion
of the following very practical topics:
the preparation or “make ready” for
printing; recent development in printing
with cross references to the article
<span class='sc'>Process</span>; and a paragraph on the management
of a printing house.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proof-Reading</div>

<p class='c007'>From this closing paragraph and the
article on <span class='sc'>Printing</span>, the student is referred
to the article <span class='sc'>Proof-Reading</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 438)
which is by John A.
Black, head press
reader of the 10th edition of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica, and John Randall,
sub-editor of the <i>Athenaeum</i> and of
<i>Notes and Queries</i> and former secretary
of the London Association of Correctors
of the Press, so that this article, like all
the other articles on the subject of book-making,
is written by eminent practical
authorities on the subject.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bookbinding</div>

<p class='c007'>The same is true of the article <span class='sc'>Bookbinding</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 216), which naturally
follows in a systematic course of
study. This is by
Cyril J. H. Davenport,
assistant keeper
of books in the British Museum and
author of <i>History of the Book</i>, etc. This
article is illustrated with 14 figures,
including 8 in halftone, showing typical
fine bindings. The other illustrations
show machines and processes used in
binding. Besides a historical sketch
of book-binding the article treats of the
following topics:</p>

<p class='c007'>Modern methods and modern binding
designers; machine binding, machine
sewing, rounding and backing, casing,
wiring, and blocking. A case-making
machine, a casing-in machine and a
blocking machine are shown in the illustrations.</p>

<p class='c007'>A bookbinder or a student of the subject
will find a great deal of very valuable
information elsewhere in the book, particularly
in the article <span class='sc'>Leather</span> (Vol. 16,
p. 330) by Dr. J. Gordon Parker, principal
of the Leathersellers Technical College,
London, and author of <i>Leather for
Libraries</i>, etc. The article occupies the
equivalent of 55 pages of this Guide;
and the possessor of the Britannica will
be interested to know that the leather
bindings used for its volumes were all
made according to specifications drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>up by Dr. Parker, the greatest authority
in the world on tanning, curing and
dyeing leather for book-bindings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Publishing and Book-Selling</div>

<p class='c007'>The last stages in getting the author’s
raw material “from him to the ultimate
consumer” are those in which the publisher
and bookseller
play their part; and
for a description of
their functions the
student should refer to the articles on
publishing and book-selling in the Britannica.
The article <span class='sc'>Publishing</span> (Vol.
22, p. 628) explains that publishing and
book-selling were for a long time carried
on together since “booksellers were
the first publishers of printed books, as
they had previously been the agents for
the production and exchange of authentic
manuscript copies.” The separation
of publishing from book-selling is due to
“the tendency of every composite business
to break up, as it expands, into
specialized departments.” As publishers
became a separate class the work of their
literary assistants also broke up into
specialized departments—proof-reading
and the reading of manuscripts submitted
by authors—or the work of <i>printers’</i>
readers and <i>publishers’</i> readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The importance of the work of the
publisher’s reader is dwelt upon in this
article which sketches besides the growth
of the Society of Authors in England and
of the formation there of the Publishers’
Association and the Booksellers’ Association.
The article also outlines the
methods of publishing in the United States
and gives particular prominence to the
effect on the British market of the introduction
of American books and of
American book-selling methods.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Historical and Miscellaneous Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>Among other articles of interest to the
manufacturer of books are the following:
<span class='sc'>Book</span> (Vol. 4, p. 214)
by Alfred William
Pollard, assistant
keeper of books in
the British Museum,
gives a general historical description of
books and in particular calls attention
to the great change in book-prices in the
last thirty years. “About 1894 the number
of medium-priced books was greatly
increased in England by the substitution
of single-volume novels at 6s. each
(subject to discount) for the three-volume
editions at 31s. 6d.... The preposterous
price of 10s. 6d. a volume had
been adopted during the first popularity
of the Waverley Novels and had continued
in force for the greater part of the
century.” To-day, well printed copies
of these novels sell for 1s. in England
and for 35 cents in the United
States.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be added that one of the most
striking lessons to be learned from the
Britannica, in relation to the improvements
and economies effected by the
application of the most modern processes
to the manufacture of books, is supplied
by the consideration of the Britannica
itself. The extent of the composition
and machinery involved, the accuracy
of the proof-reading, the novel employment—upon
a large scale—of India paper
and flexible bindings, the beauty of
the illustrations, and, above all, the low
price at which the product is sold, form
a combination of the very latest perfections
of every department of the industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Read too <span class='sc'>Book-collecting</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 221) also by A. W. Pollard; the article
<span class='sc'>Book Plates</span> (Vol. 4, p. 230) by Egerton
Castle, illustrated with ten cuts of book
plates (which are so well chosen that
book plate collectors have not infrequently
asked the publishers of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica for extra copies so
that they might include them in their
collections); the article <span class='sc'>Bookcase</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 221) from which the reader may be
surprised to learn that “the whole construction
and arrangement of bookcases
was learnedly discussed in the light of
experience by W. E. Gladstone in the
<i>Nineteenth Century</i> for March 1890;”
and the article <span class='sc'>Bibliography and BibliOLOGY</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>(Vol. 3, p. 908) by A. W. Pollard,
supplemented by the article <span class='sc'>Incunabula</span>
(Vol. 14, p. 369).</p>

<p class='c007'>The following alphabetical list of
articles and sections of articles, although
it does not profess to be complete, will
give the student some idea of the large
number of topics connected with the
general subject of the manufacture of
books:</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Development of Style</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>No writer can consider the use he
will make of the tools of his trade—and
the Britannica is certainly
the chief among them—unless he has
very definite views as to the particular
kind of work he is trying to do. Where
writing is regarded as a business, the art
of writing is the art of being read, and the
art of being read lies, nowadays, in convincing
the reader that you have something
fresh to say, rather than in arousing
his admiration of your way of saying
it. Writing is none the less one of the
fine arts: the modern writer must form
his style with the utmost care, and always
guard himself against the temptation
to relax his standards. But the
juggling with words, the “rhythmical sequences
of recurring consonants,” the
musical prose in which sounds are adjusted
as artfully as in verse, presuppose
readers to whom these elaborations are
delightful. Such readers are rare, to-day.
Thirty or forty years ago it was a
matter of course, in thousands of homes,
for some one member of the household to
read aloud to the others. The custom
has almost disappeared, and there has
been a change in public taste, due, perhaps,
in great measure to a change in the
<i>pace</i> at which people read. A book does
not “last” as it did.
Newspaper reading
has trained the eye
and the mind to
swifter consumption. The modern professional
writer adapts himself to the
existing conditions. He knows that those
who ride in automobiles do not peer under
tufts of leaves to look for roadside violets.
But he also knows that they want a
straight, smooth road. He endeavors to
write as concisely as possible, yet to
write so clearly that every point he makes
is made once for all; and he can work
fully as hard, and apply talents fully as
great, in forming a style that pleases by
its simple directness—or, better, that
pleases because the reader does not think
of it as “style,”—as if he were aiming at
the most elaborate ornament.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Vitalized Observation”</div>

<p class='c007'>In developing the power of clear and
concise statement, the first essential is to
form the habit of getting your “something
to say” absolutely plain to your
own mind before you attempt to say it.
A writer deliberately strives to be wordy
and vague when he is trying to misrepresent
facts, and it is impossible, when he
is groping for his facts, that he should
avoid wordiness and vagueness. The
Britannica article on Rudyard Kipling
speaks of his “powers
of observation
vitalized by imagination.”
It would be
difficult to find a phrase more tersely describing
the ideal equipment of a writer,
and Kipling’s observation is rapid observation
<i>amplified by deliberate investigation</i>.
He gets a swift impression of the
complex framework of a ship or of the intricate
machinery of a locomotive, and
then, before he writes “The Ship that
Found Herself” or “.007,” he makes as
elaborate a technical study as if he were
writing an engineering article instead of
a story. His imagination so vitalizes the
result that when you read the story, although
it describes beams and valves you
never saw, you recognize the accuracy of
his technical description as you recognize,
in an art gallery, the fidelity of a
portrait, although you never saw the person
portrayed. In using the Britannica,
the investigation by which you amplify
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>your personal observation helps you in
four ways. <i>First</i>, you correct your facts
if they need correction. Whatever your
subject may be, you find information so
authoritative that you cannot question
it. <i>Second</i>, you amplify your own observations;
you discover the underlying
causes and relations of the events or
opinions you are about to discuss. <i>Third</i>,
the reading by which you have, consciously
or unconsciously, been influenced
in forming your style, is rendered more
profitable and stimulating by your study
of the Britannica articles in which the
work of all the world’s great writers, past
and present, is analyzed by the most
brilliant critics. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Models of
Style<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Fourth</i>,
you have in the Britannica
itself such examples of
scholarly, forcible, compacted
English as cannot often be found
in contemporary books. It is not within
the province of this Guide to institute
detailed comparisons between these articles
by the leading literary men of the
day and other writings from the same
pens. But the reader will discover for
himself that the editorial policy which
demanded rigorous concision has stimulated,
not hampered, the distinguished
writers whose Britannica articles are, in
case after case, the best of their productions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Practical Tests</div>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing summary of the uses of
the Britannica to writers is based upon
reviews of the work which have appeared
in the daily and weekly press; and it may
be supplemented by brief extracts from
one or two letters to the publishers,
written by men whose reputations give
their opinions great weight. In one of
these Horace White, formerly editor of
the <i>Evening Post</i> of New York, spoke
highly of the practical utility of the Britannica.
Joseph Pulitzer, of the New
York <i>World</i>, shortly before his death
wrote: “I want to thank you for the intellectual
pleasure I enjoyed this winter
in examining this extraordinary production.
I have already distributed a dozen
sets in America as presents among <i>editors</i>
and my children. [He afterwards ordered
six more sets.] The work is a liberal education.”
John Habberton wrote: “The
new edition of the Britannica
has already cost me
hundreds of hours that I
should have given to my
work, but I do not regret the outlay, for
I have been richly repaid. There never
was a handier book for a desk or a more
readable one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not only true that no ordinary
library would supply the information to
be found in the Britannica, but it is as
true, and as relevant, that no ordinary
library presents information in a form as
stimulating to the writer who uses books
as the tools of his trade. The editor-in-chief
of the Britannica had all the
world’s greatest experts in all fields of
human knowledge and endeavour to
choose from. He chose in each instance
the expert whose knowledge was so
thorough, and whose correlation of his
special knowledge with related branches
was so complete, that his articles are not
merely “last word” information but interesting
and alive. You may remember
the new interest you felt in natural science
when you first read an essay by Huxley,
because he had the power of creating enthusiasm.
It is a justifiable figure of
speech to say that, in this sense, the Britannica
has been written by Huxleys.
Perhaps you have ransacked a public library
for some out-of-the-way fact and
finally found it, in skeleton form, and in
crabbed German, in <i>Meyer</i> or <i>Brockhaus</i>
or some other German encyclopaedia. Or
did your search end by finding the fact in
<i>Larousse</i> or <i>La Grande Encyclopédie</i>, in
some clever phrase, so brilliantly written,
so strikingly put, that it was the phrase
and not the fact that you had got—and
you felt that the Frenchman had hidden
the fact, if he ever had had it, in his epigram?
You may have wished, then, for
a third type of encyclopaedia which
should be “German-thorough” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“French-interesting.” Such a combination
is the Britannica,—more authoritative,
more up-to-date, more interesting,
than any other book.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Journalist’s Needs</div>

<p class='c007'>A newspaper man, reporter or editor,
must be informed at a moment’s notice
on any one of so large a number and so
wide a range of topics that the best library
of reference
obtainable can be
none too good for him. This is especially
true of the man on the smaller newspaper
which does not have the luxury of specialists
on its editorial staff, or of many reporters
dividing among them the work
of gathering news on such lines that each
may work in a field with which he is intimately
acquainted and in which he is
particularly versed. And the rural newspaper
is, besides, further from good public
libraries and financially less able to
have a large office library. The authority,
the scope, the interest and the convenience
of the Britannica make it just the
book to fill these varied needs of the newspaper
man. If he has to write a “murder
story” in which some unusual poison has
been used, he can find a full description of
the origin, the use, the action and the tests
of the drug by turning to the Britannica—instead
of hunting for (and then through)
a text book on medicine. And if, on the
same day, or the next, he must write an
editorial on the tariff, he will find in the
article <span class='sc'>Tariff</span>, in the articles <span class='sc'>Free
Trade</span> and <span class='sc'>Protection</span>, and in that part
of the article <span class='sc'>United States</span> which deals
with the country’s economic history, the
information that he wants; and he can get
it quickly, and can be sure of its being
authoritative.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the Britannica is evidently <i>the</i> work
of reference for the writer, how is he to
use it?</p>

<p class='c007'>It has already been suggested that he
will find authoritative and recent information
on any topic connected with the subject
on which he is writing. It would be
interesting to see—or at least to imagine—how
largely the Britannica might be
used as a source for fiction. A novelist
with an appetite for human documents
like Balzac’s or like that of Charles Reade—with
his many albums full of newspaper
clippings,—could satisfy himself with the
Britannica, taking his characters “from
life” in its biographical and historical articles
and his setting from its geographical
articles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Literary Criticism</div>

<p class='c007'>It has already been suggested that the
writer will find in the Britannica the
clearness and conciseness of style which
he cannot but wish to attain in his own
work. Here he has the writings of great
masters of English. He may remember
Robert Louis Stevenson’s story of how he
played “the sedulous ape” to the great
stylists; and in the Britannica he can
read not only an excellent sketch of Stevenson
by Edmund Gosse, his friend and
a well-known essayist, but Stevenson’s
own article on Béranger. He may read
Matthew Arnold on Sainte-Beuve; Walter
Besant on Froissart and on Richard
Jefferies; John Burroughs on Walt Whitman;
G. W. Cable on William Cullen
Bryant; Edmund
Kerchever Chambers
on Shakespeare:
Ernest Hartley Coleridge

Leonardo, etc.; Austin Dobson on Fielding,
Hogarth, Richardson, etc.; Henry
van Dyke on Emerson; John Fiske on
Francis Parkman; Richard Garnett on T.
L. Peacock and on Satire; Israel Gollancz
on “The Pearl”; Edmund Gosse on many
literary <i>genres</i>, on Ibsen, etc.; Edward
Everett Hale on James Freeman Clarke
and on Edward Everett; Frederic Harrison
on Ruskin; W. E. Henley on James
Fenimore Cooper; William Price James
on Barrie, Henley and Kipling; Prince
Karageorgevitch on Marie Bashkirtseff;
Stanley Lane-Poole on Richard Burton;
Andrew Lang on Ballads, Molière, etc.;
Henry Cabot Lodge on Albert Gallatin;
E. V. Lucas on Jane Austen and Charles
Lamb; Lord Macaulay on Bunyan, Goldsmith,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Johnson and Pitt; David Masson
on Milton; Brander Matthews on Mark
Twain; Alice Meynell on Mrs. Browning;
William Minto on Dryden, Pope, Spenser
and Wordsworth; John Nichol on Robert
Burns; Charles Eliot Norton on George
William Curtis; Mark Pattison on Casaubon,
Erasmus, Macaulay and Thomas
More; W. H. Pollock on Thackeray and
de Musset; Quiller-Couch on Thomas
Edward Brown; Whitelaw Reid on Greeley;
C. F. Richardson on Bronson Alcott
and John Fiske; W. M. Rossetti on
Shelley; Viscount St. Cyres on Fénelon
and Madame Guyon; Saintsbury on
French literature, Balzac, Montaigne,
Rabelais, etc.; Carl Schurz on Henry
Clay; H. E. Scudder on Lowell and Harriet
Beecher Stowe; Thomas Seccombe
on Boswell, Dickens, Charles Lever, etc.;
William Sharp (“Fiona McLeod”) on
Thoreau; Clement Shorter on the Brontës,
Crabbe, Cowper and Mrs. Gaskell; W. W.
Skeat on Layamon; E. C. Stedman on
Whittier; Sir Leslie Stephen on Browning
and Carlyle; Richard Henry Stoddard on
Hawthorne; Swinburne on Beaumont and
Fletcher, Congreve, Hugo, Landor, Marlowe,
Mary, Queen of Scots; John Addington
Symonds on the Renaissance,
Machiavelli, Tasso, etc.; Arthur Symons
on Hardy, Mallarmé, Verlaine; W. P.
Trent on Sidney Lanier; A. W. Ward on
Drama; Mrs. Humphry Ward on Lyly;
Theodore Watts-Dunton on Poetry, Sonnet,
Borrow, Wycherley, Matthew Arnold;
Arthur Waugh on William Morris, Walter
Pater; and G. E. Woodberry on American
Literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more you know of the subjects or
authors in this list the more likely you
will be to say what a Western professor
of theology said, in reviewing the articles
in the Britannica dealing with the Bible:
“They are the very authorities that I
would have chosen to write these articles!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Britannica will serve the professional
author in other ways than by
giving him information in special fields
and by keeping before him admirable
models of style. He might well follow any
of the courses suggested in the chapter on
<i>Literature</i> in this Guide; and if he will
read the articles on great authors written
by great authors, already mentioned, he
will have a doubly valuable course in
biographical criticism by the ablest of
literary critics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any newspaper writer or contributor
to the periodical press should read such
articles as:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Newspapers and Magazines</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Newspapers</span> (Vol. 19, p. 544; equivalent
to 125 pages of this Guide), by Hugh
Chisholm, editor-in-chief of the Britannica,
with sections
on the price of
newspapers by Lord
Northcliffe, on illustrated
papers by Clement Shorter, general
information on American newspapers, and
an elaborate historical account of British,
American and foreign newspapers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Periodicals</span> (Vol. 21, p. 151; equivalent
to 40 pages in this Guide), by Henry
Richard Tedder, librarian of the Athenaeum
Club of London, treats the subject
under the heads: <i>British</i>, <i>United States</i>,
<i>Canada</i>, <i>South Africa</i>, <i>Australia and New
Zealand</i>, <i>West Indies and British Crown
Colonies</i>, <i>India and Ceylon</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Germany</i>,
<i>Austria</i>, <i>Italy</i>, <i>Belgium</i>, <i>Holland</i>,
<i>Denmark</i>, <i>Norway</i>, <i>Sweden</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Portugal</i>,
<i>Greece</i>, <i>Russia</i>, and <i>other Countries</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Societies, Learned</span> (Vol. 25, p. 309),
also by H. R. Tedder, deals with the publications
of such societies and classifies
them (with geographical sub-classification
for each head) under <i>Science Generally</i>,
<i>Mathematics</i>, <i>Astronomy</i>, <i>Physics</i>,
<i>Chemistry</i>, <i>Geology</i>, <i>Mineralogy</i> and <i>Palaeontology</i>,
<i>Meteorology</i>, <i>Microscopy</i>, <i>Botany
and Horticulture</i>, <i>Zoology</i>, <i>Anthropology</i>,
<i>Sociology</i>, <i>Medicine and Surgery</i>,
<i>Engineering and Architecture</i>, <i>Naval and
Military Science</i>, <i>Agriculture and Trades</i>,
<i>Literature</i>, <i>History and Archaeology</i>, and
<i>Geography</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Local information in regard to newspapers
and journalism will be found in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>separate local articles. Thus under Boston,
Philadelphia, New York City, New
Orleans, San Francisco, etc., there is
valuable information in regard to these
cities as literary centers and about their

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIII<br> <span class='c014'>FOR TEACHERS</span></h3>
</div>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Teacher’s “Factor of Safety”</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>Every teacher has one pupil who
tries harder than any of the
others to absorb knowledge, and
yet is never content with the progress
made, who knows how hard the
teacher works, and yet is never satisfied
with the teacher—and that pupil
is the teacher’s self. For every other
learner there is a limit to the amount
of knowledge to be acquired, but in
the case of the teacher a “standard” is
supposed to indicate no more than an
indispensable minimum. When you are
trying to make your pupils master a
text-book, the volume seems to contain a
most stupendous mass of learning, and
when one of them asks you a question
about the subject with which the text-book
deals, that particular point is sure
to be one that the text-book does
not cover. What engineers call the
“factor of safety,” the margin by which
the strength of materials must exceed
the stress it is expected to encounter, is,
for the teacher, incalculable. It is, of
course, a favorite
pastime of parents
to send a child to
school primed with
some question “to
ask Teacher,” selecting an enigma that
has been for centuries a battle-ground
for scholars or scientists. And, apart
from these malicious pitfalls, children
themselves seem, quite innocently, to
hit upon questions of extraordinary
difficulty. A rebuff, a careless response,
or, worst of all, an ingenious evasion of
the issue, is fatal to the teacher’s authority
and influence. “Ask me that again,
to-morrow morning,” is the phrase with
which a conscientious teacher often
meets such a contingency. And then
how a fagged brain is tormented that
evening, how the few books available
(and they are likely to be a very few if
there is no public library at hand) are
searched in vain! That is not all. If
it be true that the teacher is the most
diligent, yet always the least satisfied,
of all the teacher’s pupils, it is equally
true that many of the most puzzling
questions with which the teacher is confronted
arise in the teacher’s own mind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Answers to All Questions</div>

<p class='c007'>The question-answering power of the
Britannica is therefore of cardinal importance
to the teacher, and is to be considered
not only in connection with the
use of the work for reference, but also in
the selection of such courses of reading
as may be expected to supply information
of the kind that
questions most
often demand. And
this question-answering
power lies in three characteristics of
the work, and may be measured by the
extent to which the three are found in
it: broad scope, unimpeachable authority
and convenient arrangement. Its scope
covers the whole range of human knowledge,
everything that mankind has
achieved, attempted, believed or studied.
Its authority is doubly vouchsafed. The
fact that the Britannica is published by
the University of Cambridge (England),
one of the world’s oldest and most famous
seats of learning, in itself gives such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>guarantee as no other Encyclopaedia
has ever offered, and the assurance thus
given may be regarded as showing,
chiefly, that there are no errors of omission,
for against the existence of the errors
of commission there is a further guarantee.
The articles are signed by 1,500 contributors,
including the foremost specialists
in every department of knowledge.
Among this army of collaborators, chosen
from twenty countries, there are no less
than 704 members of the staffs of 146
universities and colleges. This means
that by means of the Britannica the
youngest teacher in the most isolated
village is brought into stimulating contact
with the great leaders of the teaching
profession. Its arrangement gives it
the advantages of a universal library,
providing the varied courses of reading
outlined in this Guide, and those also
of a work of reference which yields an
immediate answer to every conceivable
question. The index of 500,000 entries
instantly leads the enquirer to any item
of information in the 40,000 articles.
No teacher could hope to form, in the
course of a lifetime, a collection of separate
books which would contain anywhere
near as much information.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Library of Text-Books</div>

<p class='c007'>In another relation, the Britannica is
of daily service to anyone engaged in
educational work. It has already been
remarked that the
teacher needs a “factor
of safety,” a reserve
of knowledge
beyond that which is directly called for
in the ordinary routine of the class room.
But in the very course of that routine,
there is also a need for co-ordinated
knowledge, presented in a form available
for use in teaching, of a more advanced
kind than that in the text-books with
which pupils are provided. And the
Britannica is, in itself, a vast collection
of text-books.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Shotwell, of Columbia University,
recently wrote to the publishers
a letter in which he said: “I shall use
the articles in the Encyclopaedia Britannica
which deal with industrial processes
as a substitute for a text-book in one
of my courses in Social and Industrial
History and have especially in mind
the splendid treatment of the cotton
industry by Professor S. J. Chapman
and others.” A large number of Britannica
articles have, by permission,
been reprinted, word for word, for use
as text-books; and it is impossible to say
how many have been paraphrased, and,
in a form less clear and vivid than the
originals, similarly employed. The writers
of the Britannica have, among them,
done so large a share of the world’s
recent work in research and criticism,
that no one who is engaged in writing
a text-book or in preparing a course of
lectures should fail to use the work as a
check to test the completeness and the
accuracy of independent investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately, the system of monthly
payments has enabled teachers to purchase
the Britannica to an extent which,
in view of their limited resources, is a
striking evidence of their earnest desire
to perfect their professional equipment.
In some cases two and even three
teachers have combined their efforts in
order that they might jointly possess
the work. But whatever may be the
difficulties to be overcome, it is certain
that the Britannica is, for the teacher,
an instrument as directly productive
as a technical library is for a doctor or
a lawyer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A professor in an eastern college
wrote to the publishers: “It has become
‘the collection of books’ which Carlyle
might term ‘the true university’”; and
the practical head of a business school in
Pennsylvania says: “By its purchase, I
have secured access to a university
education.” A well known professor of
German calls it “a <i>Hausschatz</i> of amazing
richness and variety,” and adds: “I hope
you will not be sued at law for an attempt
to monopolize the market for profitable
and entertaining literature.” The president
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of a southern university wrote: “It
is the first book to consult, the one book
to own, if you can own but one.” And
a Harvard professor says: “I have been
particularly interested in some of the
recent phases of European history. Concerning
some movements, about which
it is as yet extremely difficult to find
material in books, I have found the Encyclopaedia
most useful.” A teacher in
a theological seminary exclaims: “What
a university of solid training it would
be for a young student, if he would spend
an hour each day reading the work,
volume by volume, and including all
the articles except those of a technical
nature belonging to other departments
than his own!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is what teachers have said of the
value to them of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica. Specialists in school-hygiene
and school librarians have also noted
the advantage of the light, handy volumes
printed on India paper—one weighs
no more than two monthly magazines—,
which may be easily held at the proper
angle for eye-focus on a large page.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher will find in this Guide
valuable suggestions about particular
subjects which he may wish to teach or
study,—such as history, literature, language
and biology. In this chapter we
suggest a general course.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Theory of Education</div>

<p class='c007'>Let him begin with the article <span class='sc'>Education</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 951), which is the equivalent
in length of 120 pages of the size
and type of this Guide, and of which
the first part is by James Welton, professor
of education in the University of
Leeds and author of <i>Logical Bases of
Education</i>, etc., the sections on national
systems by G. B. M. Coore, assistant
secretary of the London Board of Education,
and that on the United States
by Nicholas Murray Butler, president of
Columbia University.
This valuable
article begins with a
discussion of the
meaning of the term “Education,” excludes
John Stuart Mill’s extension to
everything which “helps to shape the
human being,” and narrows the meaning
to definitely personal work,—the true
“working” definition for the practical
teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>The section on educational theory
might equally well be styled a sketch
of the history of education and will
prove valuable to the teacher preparing
for a licence-examination in this subject
or for a normal training course. It
discusses old Greek education with
special attention to Spartan practice,
Plato’s theory and Aristotle’s, and the
gradual change from the point of view
of the city-state to Hellenistic cosmopolitanism.
The older Roman education,
practical and given by father to son, is
contrasted with the later Hellenized
training, largely by Greek slaves, largely
rhetorical and largely summed up in
Quintilian’s <i>Institutio</i>. The contest between
the pagan system and Christianity
is shown to have culminated in monasticism;
and barbarian inroads stifled
classical culture until the Carolingian
revival under Alcuin in the 8th century
and the scholastic revival (11th to 13th
centuries) of Abelard, Aquinas and
Arabic workings over of Aristotle. Scholastic
education is considered especially
in relation to the first great European
universities and the schools of the Dominicans,
Franciscans and Brethren of
the Common Life, and in contrast to
chivalry, the education of feudalism.
The Renaissance is treated at greater
length, and this is followed by sections
on the influence of the Reformation on
education, and the consequent growth
of Jesuit schools. The keynote of the
story thereafter is reform,—the movement
away from the classics, toward
natural science, and, especially after the
French Revolution, by means of new
methods and theories, notably those of
Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Froebel and Herbart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remainder of the article <span class='sc'>EducaTION</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>deals with national systems of
education: French, German, Swiss, Belgian,
Dutch, Scotch, Irish, English,
Welsh and American, with an excellent
bibliography. These, and other, national
systems are also treated from
another point of view in the articles on
the separate countries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Articles on Great Schools</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Education</span> should naturally
be followed by a study of the article
<span class='sc'>Universities</span> (Vol. 27, p. 748—about
100 pages, if printed in the style of this
Guide) by James Bass Mullinger (author
of the <i>History of Cambridge</i>, <i>The Schools
of Charles the Great</i>, etc.) and, for
American universities, by Daniel Coit
Gilman, late president
of Johns Hopkins
University; and
by a reading of articles
on the great universities, as for
instance, Oxford, Cambridge, Aberdeen,
Glasgow, St. Andrews, Dublin, Harvard,
Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Princeton,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, California,
Leland Stanford, Jr., etc. The
student should then turn to the article
<span class='sc'>Schools</span> (Vol. 24, p. 359; equivalent to
about 40 pages of this Guide) by Arthur
Francis Leach, author of <i>English Schools
at the Reformation</i>, who gives a summary
of what is known of Greek, Roman and
English schools.</p>

40 pages in the form of this Guide,
by Sir Philip Magnus, author of <i>Industrial
Education</i>, member of the
Royal Commission on technical instruction
(1881–1884) and, in 1907,
president of the education section of
the British Association.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Study of Psychology</div>

<p class='c007'>Of equal importance with this course
on the history of education, for the student
taking the licence-examination or
for a teacher taking an examination
for a higher grade licence or a principalship,
is a course in Psychology in the
Britannica. This will be found largely
in the great article on <span class='sc'>Psychology</span> (Vol.
22, p. 547; equivalent in length to 200
pages of this Guide) by James Ward.
The systematic
treatment of the
subject in this article
is particularly
valuable to the teacher, whether the
object desired is to review the entire
subject, sharpening one’s impressions
from a longer course of reading; to get a
general grounding in the subject—for
which a careful study of this one article
will suffice; or to make one’s self more
certain of his comprehension of any part
of the subject. It is not practicable
to give an outline of this article here,
but a few of its special topics are listed
below:</p>

<p class='c020'>General analysis of the subject</p>

<ul class='index c026'>
  <li class='c018'>Attention</li>
  <li class='c018'>Theory of presentations</li>
  <li class='c018'>Sensation</li>
  <li class='c018'>Perception</li>

  <li class='c018'>Relation of Body and Mind</li>
  <li class='c018'>Comparative Psychology</li>
</ul>

<p class='c007'>Besides the general article with its
systematic summary of the subject, the
Britannica contains many briefer articles
on special topics, so that the teacher will
find not only an excellent text-book of
the subject in Prof. Ward’s article, but
also an elaborate dictionary or encyclopaedia
of psychological terms or topics.
Among the topics treated in this “Dictionary
of Psychology” are:</p>

<p class='c007'>Furthermore, the teacher will find the
Britannica a valuable biographical dictionary.

if he has looked up the biographical
articles mentioned in connection with
the history of education. The following

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIV<br> <span class='c014'>FOR MINISTERS</span></h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Great Preachers</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The minister or candidate for the
ministry will find a valuable course
of reading laid out for him in this
Guide under the heading <i>Bible Study</i>, and
it might be said with little exaggeration
that <i>any</i> systematic course of reading in
the Encyclopaedia Britannica should add
to the efficiency and power of one who
would be an ideal pastor. If the schools
of the Middle Ages could truly call all the
arts and sciences hand-maids and helpers
to Theology, much more truly, in the
present age, should the minister, in order
that he may minister truly, know not
merely the history of the Bible and of the
Church, the results of modern criticism,
and of comparative religion and folk-lore,
but, almost as fully, general history, literature,
philosophy, psychology, education,
something of the fine arts, much of
law and political science, and still more of
social science and economics. In a period
of specialization he cannot afford to be a
specialist—or, it might be nearer the
truth to say that, like every other true
specialist, he must make all knowledge,
all the circle of the sciences, tributary to
his specialty, which
is the knowledge and
the improvement of
the human soul. The
suggestions that follow must necessarily
be fragmentary, and should be considered
as including merely a few topics not
covered in the chapter on <i>Bible Study</i> nor
in the other courses which, as has just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>been suggested, a minister might profitably
pursue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Sermon</span> (Vol. 24, p. 673) is
by Edmund Gosse, librarian of the House
of Lords, biographer of John Donne,
Jeremy Taylor and Dr. Thomas Browne.
The writer is especially conversant with
the English literature of the 17th century,
in the middle of which, to quote his
article, “the sermon became one of the
most highly-cultivated forms of intellectual
entertainment in Great Britain, and
when the theatres were closed at the
Commonwealth it grew to be the only
public form of eloquence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Each name on the following list of great
preachers is accompanied by volume and
page reference to the biographical sketch
in the Britannica, containing criticism of
the preacher and a bibliography of his
works and of works about him, so that the
articles supply the basis for a study of
the world’s great preachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>These lists could easily be made longer
and fuller, but the articles mentioned give
such a view of the great preachers of the
world as cannot fail to stimulate any
minister. Supplementing what has been
said above about the necessity of the
minister’s being a well-rounded man, it
may be worth while to notice that Donne
and Keble and, in a less degree, Doane
and Muhlenberg, were poets as well as
preachers; that Cudworth was known as
the founder of the Cambridge Platonists,
and Jowett as the translator of Plato,
Barrow as a mathematician, second, in
his day, only to Isaac Newton, Edward
Everett Hale as an essayist and writer of
short stories, and McCook as a great
naturalist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The minister will find the Britannica an
excellent encyclopaedia of comparative
religion and of church history, with the
newest and most authoritative information
on any subject in this field. For a
brief outline course in these topics let him
read:</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Religion</span> (Vol. 23, p. 61;
equivalent to 50 pages of this Guide), by
Dr. Joseph Estlin Carpenter, principal
of Manchester College, Oxford, and Robert
R. Marett, fellow and tutor of Exeter
College, Oxford, author of the <i>Threshold
of Religion</i> and contributor to the Britannica
of articles on <span class='sc'>Prayer</span>, <span class='sc'>Ritual</span>, etc.
This article is made up of: a general introduction
sketching the history of the
study of religions, especially in the last
century, and concluding that “the origin
of religion can never be determined archaeologically
or historically; it must be
sought conjecturally through psychology”;
a section on primitive religion,
which is a remarkable summary of all
that is known of this subject; and a
section on the higher religions which
discusses developments of animism, transition
to polytheism, polytheism, the order
of nature (a half-way stage to monotheism),
monotheism, classification of religions,
revelation, ethics and eschatology
and bibliography.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another class of articles comprises <span class='sc'>Ancestor
Worship</span>, <span class='sc'>Animal Worship</span>,

Lang, Stanley Arthur Cooke and R. R.
Marett.</p>

Clark University, Worcester; in the article

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXV<br> <span class='c014'>FOR PHYSICIANS, SURGEONS AND DENTISTS</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The Britannica adds so largely
to medical literature that, in outlining
the services which the work
can render to those engaged in the prevention
and treatment of disease, it is
desirable to define the limits, rather than
to insist upon the extent, of the plan
adopted by the technical assistant editors
to whom the Editor-in-chief entrusted
the control of this important part of
the undertaking. It is true that the 644
medical articles, many of which might
be described as books in themselves,
cover the whole field of anatomy, physiology,
pathology, therapeutics, surgery,
pharmacology, medical education, medical
jurisprudence and medical biography.
It is also true that the writers who sign
these articles are specialists of world-wide
authority, and that the total
number of words and illustrations in these
articles is as great as would be required
for a complete encyclopaedic hand-book
of medical science. But, notwithstanding
all this wealth of matter and of international
collaboration, the Britannica
does not profess to take the place of the
elementary working library in daily use
by every professional man. “Working
library” is, however, an elastic term,
and it is used here to mean only the handbooks
which constitute an irreducible
minimum, the few without which no
beginner would venture to establish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>himself in practice. Certain manuals
are, to the practitioner, what mathematical
tables are to the engineer; and
it is not the function of the Britannica
to duplicate what the practitioner already
possesses, nor yet, for example, to
include a pharmacopoeia in a book used
by the general public.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Encyclopaedic Method</div>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, no professional
man restricts himself a day longer than
he must to the bare modicum of medical
literature with which
he may have been
forced, at first, to do
his best; and when
he can add <i>anything</i>
to it, there is nothing he will use so
often, or find so helpful, as the Britannica.
It may be well to define in general, its
professional uses, before dealing in detail
with the articles included in this
course of reading.</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) The system of technical collaboration
is, in the Britannica, organized and
coördinated with a completeness which
gives the medical articles an authority
and impartiality often lacking in isolated
treatises. The contributors were selected
with a view to their recognized ability
only, whereas the publication of medical
works is too often an outcome of the
writer’s ambitions, which, however legitimate
they may be, are no proof of his
capacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) The Britannica articles were written
for the sole purpose of being used in
their present form. A great part of
current medical literature originates in
lectures to students, and retains too
much of its first form to be satisfactory
to the professional man.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) The articles are all based upon
an original and recent survey of knowledge,
and thus contain information which
cannot be found in reprints of standard
medical works insufficiently brought up
to date by additions to earlier editions.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) In relation to statistics, to administrative
and legislative provisions regarding
public health, to hospitals and
other public institutions, the broadly
international character of the Britannica,
with its contributions from twenty
different countries, gives a scope which
the private writer cannot attain.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) The great number of biographies
of physicians, surgeons and men who
devote themselves exclusively to research,
gives professional men access to
information which they cannot elsewhere
obtain.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6) Chemistry, bacteriology, general
biology, botany, psychology and other
sciences allied to the more immediate
field of medicine are fully treated by
specialists of the highest authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>(7) Apart from the definite occupational
diseases (fully discussed in the
Britannica), there is often a relation between
the pathological results of overwork
and the routine of the patient’s business
life. Every branch of industry and commerce
is treated in detail in the Britannica,
and the insight which the physician
may thus gain will often be of service
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>(8) The Britannica not only enlarges
the medical library of the practitioner,
but gives him, and the members of his
family, the use of <i>the only complete library
of general information</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Scope of the Medical Section</div>

<p class='c007'>Specifically, the medical and surgical
section of the Britannica comprises
3 general articles, constituting
broad systematic surveys of the various
provinces of the subject: 103 articles on
anatomy and physiology, which are
partly surgical; 265
articles on pathology;
75 on pharmacology;
21 on public
health, in addition to the articles on
dentistry and on veterinary science,
and 170 biographies. But this comprehensive
scheme does not by any means
include all the material of value to the
medical man. The sister sciences of
chemistry, physics, biology, botany, zoology
and psychology, have much to offer
him. A consultation of the list appended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>to this section will show how the needs
of the physician and surgeon are served
by the Encyclopaedia. It must suffice
here to call attention briefly to some of
the more important contributions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking up, first, the more general
articles, there is <span class='sc'>Medicine</span> (Vol. 18, p. 41)
containing about 35,000 words. This deals
with the history and development of the
science. Dr. J. F. Payne of the Royal
College of Physicians, London, traces
its history from the earliest known
times to the middle of the 19th century;
and Sir T. C. Allbutt, professor of physic
in Cambridge University, completes
this review with a section on <i>Modern
Progress</i> (p. 55). Of high practical value
is <span class='sc'>Medical Jurisprudence</span> or <span class='sc'>Forensic
Medicine</span> (Vol. 16, p. 25), by H. H.
Littlejohn, professor of forensic medicine,
University of Edinburgh, and T. A.
Ingram. This deals solely with that
branch of the science which has to do
with the application of medical knowledge
to certain questions of civil and criminal
law. There are discussions of questions
affecting the civil or social rights of individuals,
and injuries to the person,
the function of the physician in questions
of mutilation, homicide, infanticide, poisoning,
etc. <span class='sc'>Medical Education</span> (Vol.
18, p. 23) is a useful reference article by
Sir John Batty Tuke, Dr. W. H. Howell,
dean of the medical faculty, Johns Hopkins
University, and Dr. H. L. Hennessy,
furnishing data on the educational qualifications
necessary to the practice of
medicine in Europe and America.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Anatomy, Embryology, and Physiology</div>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Frederick G. Parsons, vice-president
of the Anatomical Society of Great
Britain and Ireland,
lecturer on Anatomy
at St. Thomas’s
Hospital, London,
contributes the
general article <span class='sc'>Anatomy</span> (Vol. 1, p.
920) which goes deeply into its history,
and has further sections on <i>Modern
Human Anatomy</i> (Anthropotomy) and
<i>Anatomy, Superficial</i> and <i>Artistic</i>. This
noted authority also writes detailed and
fully illustrated articles on the anatomy
and embryology of the <span class='sc'>Brain</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 392); <span class='sc'>Heart</span> (Vol. 13, p.
129); <span class='sc'>Eye</span> (Vol. 10, p. 91); <span class='sc'>Ear</span> (Vol. 8,
791); <span class='sc'>Olfactory System</span> (Vol. 20, p. 77);
<span class='sc'>Lymphatic System</span> (Vol. 17, p. 166);
<span class='sc'>Vascular System</span> (Vol. 27, p. 926);
<span class='sc'>Nervous System</span> (Vol. 19, p. 400);
<span class='sc'>Muscular System</span> (Vol. 19, p. 51);
<span class='sc'>Reproductive System</span> (Vol. 23, p. 129);
and <span class='sc'>Respiratory System</span> (Vol. 23, p.
184) and on the <span class='sc'>Skeleton</span> (Vol. 25, p.
169); <span class='sc'>Skin and Exoskeleton</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 188); <span class='sc'>Skull</span> (Vol. 25, p. 196); <span class='sc'>Joints</span>
(Vol. 15, p. 483); and <span class='sc'>Nerve</span> (Vol. 19,
p. 394). Another valuable anatomical
article is <span class='sc'>Connective Tissues</span> (Vol. 6,
p. 958), by Dr. T. G. Brodie of the University
of Toronto. Prof. Adam Sedgwick
writes a most excellent general
and historical account of <span class='sc'>Embryology</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 314); and Dr. Hans A. E.
Driesch of Heidelberg University adds to
it a section <i>Physiology of Development</i>
(p. 329), treating of the laws that govern
the development of the organism. The
general article <span class='sc'>Physiology</span> (Vol. 21,
p. 554) is from the pen of the celebrated
Prof. Max Verworn of the University
of Bonn, and to this there are closely
linked, according to the new plan of
the Britannica, extensive and detailed
accounts of the physiology of the <span class='sc'>Brain</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 403); <span class='sc'>Sympathetic System</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 287); <span class='sc'>Spinal Cord</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 672); <span class='sc'>Muscle and Nerve</span> (Vol. 19,
p. 44); <span class='sc'>Respiratory System</span> (Vol. 23,
p. 187); <span class='sc'>Vascular System</span> (Vol. 27, p.
929); <span class='sc'>Alimentary Canal</span> (Vol. 1, p. 663);
<span class='sc'>Blood</span> (Vol. 4, p. 77), etc., by noted
specialists, including Dr. Charles S.
Sherrington, professor of physiology in
the University of Liverpool, Dr. J. S.
Haldane of Oxford University, Dr. L.
E. Hill, lecturer on physiology at the
London Hospital, Dr. P. Chalmers Mitchell,
and Dr. T. G. Brodie of the University
of Toronto.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Articles on Pathology</div>

<p class='c007'>Drs. D. J. Hamilton and Richard Muir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>are the authors of a brilliant summary of
the whole subject of <span class='sc'>Pathology</span> (Vol. 20,
p. 913) with over 50
illustrations, including
coloured plates.
The whole story of
the elevation of the science dealing with
the theory and causation of disease from a
mere philosophical abstraction to one of
the natural sciences is admirably told.
For the pathological details of various diseases
and groups of diseases the reader is
referred to <span class='sc'>Parasitic Diseases</span> (Vol. 20,
p. 770), fully illustrated, by Dr. G. Sims
Woodhead, professor of pathology, Cambridge
University, one of the notable
contributions to the Britannica; <span class='sc'>Metabolic
Diseases</span> (Vol. 18, p. 195), by
Prof. D. N. Paton of Edinburgh University;
<span class='sc'>Digestive Organs</span>, <i>Pathology</i> (Vol.
8, p. 262) by Dr. A. L. Gillespie of Edinburgh
and M. Fisher; <span class='sc'>Kidney Diseases</span>
(Vol. 15, p. 784), by Dr. J. R. Bradford
of University College Hospital, London,
and Dr. Edmund Owen, the famous
English surgeon; <span class='sc'>Bladder and Prostate
Diseases</span> (Vol. 4, p. 27); <span class='sc'>Venereal

by Sir John Batty Tuke, president of
the Neurological Society of the United
Kingdom, and medical director of the
New Staughton Hall Asylum, Edinburgh,
Dr. J. Macpherson, and Dr. L.
C. Bruce, author of <i>Studies in Clinical
Psychiatry</i>,—for this article the noted
American specialist Dr. Frederick Peterson
has written a section on <i>Hospital
Treatment</i> of the insane; <span class='sc'>Neuropathology</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 429), fully illustrated,
by Dr. F. W. Mott, the distinguished

and Ear Hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Harriet L. Hennessy is the author
of <span class='sc'>Gynaecology</span> (Vol. 12, p. 764).</p>

<p class='c007'>For more specific details there is the
complete list of articles on different diseases
and ailments under their common
names. This includes veterinary diseases,
to which branch of medicine an
admirable introduction is furnished by
<span class='sc'>Veterinary Science</span> (Vol. 28, p. 2), by
Drs. George Fleming and James MacQueen.
In the articles on diseases there
will be found accounts of the latest
methods of diagnosis and treatment, as,
for example, the Calmette eye-test in
tubercular diseases, serum treatment
and its latest developments, vaccine
therapy, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Therapeutics</div>

<p class='c007'>The general article <span class='sc'>Therapeutics</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 793), by Dr. Sir Lauder
Brunton, consulting physician to St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital,
London, author
of <i>Modern Therapeutics</i>,
etc., not only discusses both
rational and empirical therapeutics, but,
taking up the different parts of the body
considers in detail the therapeutic measures
most commonly employed in the
treatment of disease. The subjects of
<span class='sc'>Electrotherapeutics</span> (Vol. 9, p. 249);
<span class='sc'>Baths</span> (Vol. 3, p. 514); <span class='sc'>Balneotherapeutics</span>

863) and <span class='sc'>X-Ray Treatment</span> (Vol. 28,
p. 887) have separate articles devoted
to them. The last is by Dr. H. L.
Jones, clinical lecturer on medical electricity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital,
London.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with the subject of
therapeutics, mention must be made of
<span class='sc'>Pharmacology</span> (Vol. 21, p. 347), by
Professor Stockman of the University of
Glasgow, in which will be found an interesting
history of drugs, and a classification
into 28 groups with a description
of the effect of each remedy. To
this valuable material Dr. H. L. Hennessy
has added a section, <i>Terminology
in Therapeutics</i> (p. 352)—a general explanation
of the common names used in
the classification of drugs. The list at
the end of this chapter indicates the
separate articles on drugs and on materials
from which the principal drugs are
obtained.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Surgery</div>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Charles Creighton of King’s College,
Cambridge, writes on the history
of <span class='sc'>Surgery</span> (Vol. 26, p. 125) and the
famous English Surgeon,
Dr. Edmund Owen the
section <i>Modern Practice of
Surgery</i> (p. 129) in which are discussed
antiseptic and aseptic surgery, drainage
tubes, bloodless operations, Röntgen
rays, use of radium, etc. The article
<span class='sc'>Surgical Instruments and Appliances</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 132) is fully illustrated.
Dr. Owen also contributes articles on
the surgery of the different organs, the
article <span class='sc'>Bone</span>, <i>Diseases and Injuries</i>
(Vol. 4, p. 200) and many accounts of
diseases and disorders that come within
the province of the surgeon, such as
<span class='sc'>Appendicitis</span> (Vol. 2, p. 217); <span class='sc'>Peritonitis</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 171); <span class='sc'>Hernia</span> (Vol.
13, p. 372); <span class='sc'>Fistula</span> (Vol. 10, p.
438); <span class='sc'>Varicose Veins</span> (Vol. 27, p. 920),
and <span class='sc'>Haemorrhoids</span> (Vol. 12, p. 805).
Sir Alexander R. Simpson, emeritus
professor of midwifery and the diseases
of women and children, University of
Edinburgh, writes on <span class='sc'>Obstetrics</span> (Vol.
19, p. 962); Dr. Louis Courtauld, formerly
research scholar, Middlesex Hospital
Cancer Laboratories, on <span class='sc'>Tumour</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 370); Dr. Arthur Shadwell,
of the Epidemiological Society, on <span class='sc'>Cancer</span>,
with a special account of cancer
research; and H. C. Crouch, teacher of
anaesthetics at St. Thomas’s Hospital,
London, on <span class='sc'>Anaesthesia and Anaesthetics</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 907).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Medical Biographies</div>

<p class='c007'>A most interesting, unusual and instructive
course of reading on the history
and development of medicine may
be based on the
biographical articles
alone. In <span class='sc'>Aesculapius</span>
(Vol. 1, p.
276) we learn how the gods of Greece
effected cures. The life story of <span class='sc'>Hippocrates</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 518) is worthy of
note, for the “medical art as we now
practice it, the character of the physician
as we now understand it,” both
date from him. For information about
the theory that disease originated from
an irregular or inharmonious motion of the
body corpuscles we turn to <span class='sc'>Asclepiades</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 722). An account of the man
“out of whom the greater part of medicine
has flowed” is found in <span class='sc'>Galen</span> (Vol.
11, p. 398). The biography of the
great Arab physician and philosopher
<span class='sc'>Avicenna</span> (Vol. 3, p. 62) should not be
overlooked, nor the story of the revolt of
<span class='sc'>Paracelsus</span> (Vol. 20, p. 749). Important
and interesting, too, are the biographies
of <span class='sc'>Harvey, William</span> (Vol. 13,
p. 42); <span class='sc'>Sydenham, Thomas</span> (Vol. 26,
p. 277), the father of English medicine,
and <span class='sc'>Haller, A. von</span> (Vol. 12, p. 855),
whose work marks the beginning of modern
physiology. The work of <span class='sc'>Morgagni</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 831) in pathological anatomy
marks an epoch in medicine, and the
description in <span class='sc'>Cullen, William</span> (Vol.
7, p. 616) of his new doctrine of “irritability”
possesses a distinct interest.
The accounts of <span class='sc'>Jenner, Edward</span> (Vol.
15, p. 319), <span class='sc'>Hunter, John</span> (Vol. 13, p.
939) and <span class='sc'>Hahnemann, S.C.F.</span> (Vol. 12,
p. 819) describe momentous events in
the history of medicine at the close of
the 18th century, while among the great
names of the 19th will be found the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>chemist <span class='sc'>Pasteur</span> (Vol. 20, p. 892),
<span class='sc'>Koch, Robert</span> (Vol. 15, p. 885), <span class='sc'>Lister</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 777) and <span class='sc'>Virchow, Rudolf</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 110).</p>

<p class='c007'>It has already been noted that the
Britannica will prove an invaluable help
to medical specialists in fields of knowledge
other than their
own. The regret is
often expressed by
physicians that it is
not easy for them to study subjects
outside their profession, even when
these are closely connected with their
work. It is, unfortunately, only too
true, that material for such study is not
readily available. But with so complete
a work of reference at his disposal, and
with its highly authentic information
skillfully compressed into reasonable
space, the medical man now enjoys a
magnificent opportunity to obtain a
full acquaintance with many subjects
that he knows will assist him in the
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be impossible to name all the
articles here, but the alphabetical list at the
end of this chapter includes them, and
the attention of the physician and surgeon
is directed to <span class='sc'>Bacteriology</span> (Vol.
3, p. 156), by the late Prof. H. M. Ward
of Cambridge and Prof. V. H. Blackman
of the University of Leeds, and especially
the section <i>Pathological Importance</i> (p.
171), which Prof. Robert Muir of Glasgow
University has written; <span class='sc'>Biology</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 954), a classic article by the
late Professor Huxley, revised and
brought up-to-date by Dr. P. Chalmers
Mitchell; <span class='sc'>Heredity</span> (Vol. 13, p. 350),
also by Dr. Mitchell; <span class='sc'>Mendelism</span> (Vol.
18, p. 115), a brilliant study of the
foundations of an exact knowledge of the
physiological process of heredity, by
Prof. R. C. Punnett of Cambridge; <span class='sc'>Evolution</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 22) and <span class='sc'>Longevity</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 974), both by Dr. Mitchell;
<span class='sc'>Nutrition</span> (Vol. 19, p. 921), by Prof. D.
N. Paton and Dr. E. P. Cathcart of
Glasgow University; <span class='sc'>Dietetics</span> (Vol. 8,
p. 214), by the world-famous authority
on this subject, the late Prof. W. O. Atwater,
and R. D. Milner, formerly of the
U. S. Dept, of Agriculture; <span class='sc'>Vegetarianism</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 967), by Dr. Josiah Oldfield,
senior physician to the Lady Margaret
Fruitarian Hospital, Bromley; <span class='sc'>Climate</span>
<i>in the Treatment of Disease</i> (Vol. 6,
p. 526); <span class='sc'>Acclimatization</span> (Vol. 1, p. 114),
by the renowned scientist, Dr. A. Russel
Wallace; a very complete and up-to-date
article on <span class='sc'>Vivisection</span> (Vol. 28, p. 153),
by Dr. Stephen Paget; <span class='sc'>Psychology</span> (Vol.
22, p. 547), by Prof. James Ward of
Cambridge; <span class='sc'>Psychical Research</span> (Vol.
22, p. 544), by Andrew Lang, which is the
key to a series of 25 remarkably interesting
articles covering the entire subject;
<span class='sc'>Hypnotism</span> (Vol. 14, p. 201); <span class='sc'>Faith
Healing</span> (Vol. 10, p. 135); <span class='sc'>Suggestion</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 48); <span class='sc'>Phrenology</span> (Vol. 21, p.
534), by Professor Macalister of Cambridge;
<span class='sc'>Temperance</span> (Vol. 26, p. 578), by
Dr. Arthur Shadwell; <span class='sc'>Microscope</span> (Vol.
18, p. 392); <span class='sc'>Blindness</span>, <i>Causes and Prevention</i>
(Vol. 4, p. 60), by Sir Francis J.
Cambell, principal Royal Normal College
for the Blind, London; <span class='sc'>Deaf and Dumb</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 880), by Rev. A. H. Payne,
formerly of the National Deaf Mute College,
Washington.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject of <span class='sc'>Dentistry</span> (Vol. 8, p.
50) is covered by the highest American
authority, Dr. Edward C. Kirk, of the
University of Pennsylvania, and a full
account of the anatomy of the teeth will
be found under <span class='sc'>Teeth</span> (Vol. 26, p. 499),
by Dr. F. G. Parsons. It is, however, in
connection with bacteriology, chemistry,
metallurgy, mechanics and other subjects
with which the dentist is concerned, rather
than in connection with the technics of
his profession, that he will desire to
make use of the Britannica.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVI<br> <span class='c014'>FOR LAWYERS</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>In the days when Marshall and Story,
on the bench of the Supreme Court at
Washington, were listening to Webster’s
thunder; when Chancellor Kent was
scrutinizing precedents in New York, and
Rufus Choate quoting Justinian at Salem,
success at the bar depended upon elaborate
rhetoric and a close study of the Reports.
To-day, sound advice is in greater
demand than brilliant oratory, and questions
of fact are, as a rule, more important
and more perplexing than questions of
law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Britannica is the one great Digest
of Facts. Its articles cover all scientific,
industrial, commercial and financial subjects.
Fifteen hundred of the world’s
foremost specialists, chosen from twenty
different countries, deal not only with all
knowledge, but with the practical application
of knowledge in the laboratory, the
machine shop, in the mine, on the ship’s
deck and in the ship’s engine-room, in the
railroad office and on the railroad line.
Bankers and engineers, builders and contractors,
physicians and surgeons and
manufacturers of every kind describe the
work which they have themselves successfully
done. They explain to the lawyer
the details of his client’s own business,
which the client is almost always incapable
of explaining. They enable the lawyer
to test his client’s knowledge and his
client’s good faith. They show the lawyer
what he has to hope or to dread from
expert evidence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Volumes as Used by Lawyers</div>

<p class='c007'>In a mining town in Alaska, where the
workmen were mostly Servians, a lawyer
recently had an unusual case. The Servians
had a church,
which in the absence
of the Servian priest,
was in the charge of
a father or “papa” of
the Russian orthodox church, and he
tried to exclude from their church the entire
congregation because they disobeyed
him. The lawyer brought into court the
Encyclopaedia Britannica to prove the
independence of the Servian Church from
the authority of the Russian Church. The
Britannica was recognized as an authority
by the court, and the Servian congregation
won its suit for the use of its church
building.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Buffalo lawyer in a recent letter to
the publishers of the Britannica told of
his being retained in a case involving the
qualities of materials used in the construction
of automatic car couplers. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>read many technical works to get information
on this subject, but “the article
that to me was most instructive was that
on <span class='sc'>Iron and Steel</span> in the Encyclopaedia
Britannica.” He adds, “In my opinion
the work is invaluable to any person who
desires the means of handy reference to,
and accurate information on, any topic.”
Similar testimony from lawyers all over
the world to the usefulness of the Britannica
could be adduced in great volume.</p>

<p class='c007'>A brief reference to the different parts
of this Guide will show in a general way
the contents and value of the Britannica
in the many fields in which an attorney
may need, in connection with the preparation
of a case, immediate and authoritative
information on subjects not purely
legal.</p>

<p class='c007'>But on legal topics, also, the lawyer or
the law student will find much valuable
information.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>American Law</div>

<p class='c007'>He should read the stimulating and
suggestive article on <span class='sc'>American Law</span> (Vol.
1, p. 828), by Simeon E. Baldwin, governor
of Connecticut,
professor of constitutional
and private
international law at Yale, and formerly
chief justice of the Supreme Court of
Errors, Connecticut. Governor Baldwin’s
article points out the general identity
of origin of American and English
law, with the important exception of territory
formerly French or Spanish,—particularly
Louisiana,—a point on which
the reader will find fuller information in
the articles <span class='sc'>Louisiana</span> (Vol. 17, p. 57)
and <span class='sc'>Edward Livingston</span> (Vol. 16, p.
811). Besides he calls attention to the fact
that the state and not the nation is for
the most part the legislative unit and the
legislative authority. And this leads to
a consideration of the great part played
in American jurisprudence by the Civil
War and the consequent changes in the
Federal Constitution, especially the Fourteenth
Amendment, which has been the
basis of so many recent cases in the Supreme
Court and has “readjusted and reset
the whole system of the American
law of personal rights” by transferring
final jurisdiction from state to Federal
courts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within the Southern states the Reconstruction
period affected local law in
various ways: by putting political power
into the hands of outsiders (“carpet baggers,”
etc.), by the social revolution consequent
on the abolition of slavery, and
by the commercial assimilation of the
South to the North.</p>

<p class='c007'>Governor Baldwin points out that the
judicial department has been made partly
administrative by the artificial distribution
under most state constitutions
of governmental powers into executive,
legislative and judicial, overlooking the
administrative, and making the courts
the interpreters of statutes and giving to
them the power of deciding whether or
not statutes are constitutional.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the police powers of the states are
more and more liberally interpreted by
the Federal Supreme Court is an interesting
tendency, especially when the student
remembers that in the last year or so certain
states (notably Washington, c. 74,
<i>Laws</i> 1911, Compensation of Injured
Workmen) have definitely stated the
police power as the basis of acts which the
state supreme court might otherwise have
declared unconstitutional as depriving of
property without due process of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article on American law is supplemented:</p>

<p class='c007'>(a) in a general way by the valuable
contribution of James Bryce (author of
<i>The American Commonwealth</i>, and late
British ambassador to the United States)
on the Constitution and Government of
the United States and of the states (Vol.
27, p. 646—an article which would fill
about 50 pages of this Guide).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>State Statutes</div>

<p class='c007'>(b) more particularly, under the articles
on the separate states (as well as on
Alaska, Hawaii, Philippines and Porto
Rico), by the description of the state or
local constitution with an outline of characteristic
and peculiar statutes. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>instance, in the article <span class='sc'>Alabama</span> (Vol.
1, p. 459), the first in the Britannica
on a separate state
of the Union, there
is a general sketch of
the constitution and government with
particular attention to these points: term
of judiciary, 6 years; legislative sessions,
quadrennial; law against lobbying; executive
may not succeed himself; sheriffs
whose prisoners are lynched may be impeached;
grandfather clause, practically
disfranchising the negro—with a summary
of Giles <i>v.</i> Harris, 189 U. S. 474;
Jim Crow law; disfranchisement for vote-buying
or selling; Australian ballot law;
anti-pass law; freight rebate law; homestead
exemptions; wife’s earnings separate
property; women and child labour
laws; peonage; liquor laws.</p>

<p class='c007'>(c) by special articles, such as <span class='sc'>Homestead
and Exemption Laws</span> (Vol. 13, p.
639), <span class='sc'>Original Package</span> (Vol. 20, p. 273)
and <span class='sc'>Interstate Commerce</span> (Vol. 14, p.
711; equal to about 10 pages of this
Guide), by Prof. Frank A. Fetter of
Princeton (formerly Cornell), which deal
with purely American legal topics.</p>

<p class='c007'>(d) by legal sections in general economic
articles, for instance: in <span class='sc'>Railways</span>,
the section on <i>American Legislation</i>, by
Prof. F. H. Dixon of Dartmouth, author
of <i>State Railroad Control</i>; in <span class='sc'>Trusts</span>, by
Prof. J. W. Jenks, the great American authority
on the subject; in <span class='sc'>Employers’
Liability</span>; in <span class='sc'>Trade Unions</span> and in
<span class='sc'>Strikes and Lockouts</span>, both by Carroll
D. Wright, late U. S. Commissioner of
Labor; <span class='sc'>Bankruptcy</span>, by Edward Manson,
author of <i>Law of Bankruptcy</i>; and in
<span class='sc'>Insurance</span> (Vol. 14, especially p. 662 c).</p>

<p class='c007'>(e) by general legal articles like: <span class='sc'>Common
Law</span>; <span class='sc'>Criminal Law</span>, by W. F.
Craies, editor of Archbold <i>On Criminal
Pleading</i>; <span class='sc'>Liquor Laws</span>, by Arthur Shadwell,
author of <i>Drink, Temperance and
Legislation</i>; <span class='sc'>Medical Jurisprudence</span>, by
H. H. Littlejohn, professor of forensic
medicine in the University of Edinburgh;
<span class='sc'>Military Law</span>, by Sir John Scott, former
deputy judge-advocate-general, British
Army; <span class='sc'>Navigation Laws</span>, by James
Williams, of Lincoln College, Oxford;
<span class='sc'>Press Laws</span>; <span class='sc'>Seamen, Laws, relating
to</span>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>and (f) by sections and paragraphs on
American law in hundreds of articles on
legal topics—for list see below.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Biographies of Lawyers</div>

<p class='c007'>The following list of American jurists
does not include all American lawyers
about whom there are separate articles
in the Britannica, but
will serve to suggest a
brief course of biographical

<p class='c007'>Of great value to the student of law, as

<p class='c007'>(a) the articles <span class='sc'>Law</span>, <span class='sc'>Jurisprudence</span>
and <span class='sc'>Comparative Jurisprudence</span>, by
Paul Vinogradoff, Corpus professor of
jurisprudence at Oxford.</p>

<p class='c007'>(b) articles on national and other legal
systems, such as</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>English Law</span>, <i>History</i>, by the late
Frederick W. Maitland, Downing professor
of English law at Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Anglo-Saxon Law</span>, by Paul Vinogradoff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Germanic Laws, Early</span>, by Professor

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Code Napoléon</span>, by Jean Paul Esmein,
professor of law in the University of
Paris,
and <span class='sc'>Roman Law</span>, probably one of the
most remarkable articles in the new edition
and of the utmost importance (as in
a less degree are the articles <span class='sc'>Code</span> and
<span class='sc'>Code Napoléon</span>) to the student of civil
law. It is based on the well-known article
contributed to the Ninth Edition of
the Britannica by James Muirhead, professor
of civil law, Edinburgh; but the
article is actually the work of the reviser,
Henry Goudy, regius professor of civil
law, Oxford, and it may well be called the
best present treatment of the subject.
The article is a brief text-book in itself,
containing matter equivalent in length
to nearly 200 pages of this Guide. The
treatment is historical, beginning with
the almost mythical regal period and
throwing light on the laws before the
XII Tables, but this does not mean that
the later period, legally more important,
is not treated with proper fullness so that
the practical as well as the theoretical is
considered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Some Legal Systems</div>

<p class='c007'>Slightly remoter systems are the subjects
of separate articles: <span class='sc'>Salic Law</span>, by
Professor Pfister of the Sorbonne; <span class='sc'>Brehon
Laws</span>, by Lawrence
Ginnell, M. P.,
author of a monograph
on the subject;
<span class='sc'>Welsh Laws</span>; an elaborate article on
the little-known subject <span class='sc'>Greek Law</span>,
by John Edwin Sandys of Cambridge,

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVII<br> <span class='c014'>FOR BANKERS AND FINANCIERS</span></h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Social History</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>Of all classes of business men,
bankers and financiers study most
closely the general tendencies of
public opinion and the general course of
industrial and commercial development.
Each day’s financial news reports a position
which has been reached in the path
of a movement of which the origin and
earlier course—and therefore the direction—must
be sought in the record of
past months and years, and
sometimes in the record of
a past century. But the
banker who turns to the
standard histories in his library with the
desire to trace the course of any gradual
and long-continued development is generally
disappointed.
It is only of late that historical investigation
has been directed to social
and commercial activities rather than to
politics and wars. Yet the history of
civilization may be said to lie in the
course of finance and commerce much
more than in party strife and in civil and
international wars. For the latter always
arrest for the moment, even if they
ultimately further, the progress of civilization.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>International Finance</div>

<p class='c007'>The new Britannica has been called
“the most comprehensive of all surveys
of past and present civilization,” and its
treatment of finance and commerce possesses
a breadth and sweep directly due
to the international character of the
book. The American financier knows
that under existing conditions he must
take into account the laws and usages of
foreign countries in regard to banking,
currency, taxation, stock exchange transactions,
corporations and all the other
methods and appliances used in dealing
with money and credit. The Britannica
could not have covered this broad field
authoritatively if its articles had all been
written by Americans instead of being
contributed, as they are, by specialists of
twenty countries. And the very first
step, in examining any question of American
finance, may be to consider what has
been done abroad.
For example, there
has been adopted in
Louisiana a system
of rural credit such as was strongly urged,
for more general use, during President
Taft’s administration. That would seem
to be purely a matter of internal policy.
But for a description of the actual working
of such a system, the sources of information
are in the Britannica article
<span class='sc'>Raiffeisen</span> (Vol. 22, p. 817), the German
banker who perfected the system of agrarian
credits, in the article <span class='sc'>Schulze-Delitzsch</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>(Vol. 24, p. 383), the Saxon
economist who founded the German central
bureau of co-operative societies, and
in the article <span class='sc'>Co-Operation</span> (Vol. 7, p.
82), where the Danish system of financing
farmers is described and compared with
the German and French methods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Systematic reading in the Britannica
on financial subjects should begin with
the article <span class='sc'>Finance</span> (Vol. 10, p. 347,
equivalent to 20 pages of this Guide), by
C. F. Bastable, professor of political
economy in the University of Dublin,
whose books on economics have been
largely read in the United States. This
article deals with state revenue and expenditure,
or <i>public</i> finance, after pointing
out the prevailing looseness in the
use of the word finance. It is interesting
to know that “in the later middle ages,
especially in Germany, the word <i>finance</i>
acquired the sense of usurious or oppressive
dealing with money and capital.”
So long ago did an unpopular meaning
attach to a term connected with “big
business.” The same is true of the word
<i>usury</i>, which originally meant use, or interest;
and the Britannica in an article on
<span class='sc'>Usury</span> (Vol. 27, p. 811) says “usury, if
used in the old sense of the term could
embrace a multitude of modes of receiving
interest upon capital to which not the
slightest moral taint is attached.” In
each case there may have been some
reason besides chance for the development
of the unpleasant meaning, and it
has always been the custom of the spendthrift
and the gambler to make the wrong
use of words as well as of business methods.
But what we call public finance was
a century ago called political economy,
“political” being used strictly to apply to
the state, and “economy” in its original
sense of housekeeping or house-rule. The
word “economy” has thus become broader,
as the word “usury” has become narrower,
in significance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Early Economics</div>

<p class='c007'>It is curious to see how one page after
another of the historical section of this
article describes theories of finance which
are to-day propounded by popular
agitators as if they were absolutely new
and not only describes
them but
shows how they were
tried and how they
failed. The eastern empires taxed land
produce, usually to the extent of one fourth
or one fifth (two tithes). In Athens, under
a more elaborate system, the state owned
and administered agricultural land and
silver mines, and yet this state ownership,
instead of making for democratic equality,
resulted in too rigid a separation of
classes; and the Athenian attempt to
surtax the rich citizens in order to defray
the cost of public games and theatrical
performances and to equip ships (in this
case a close parallel to certain recent German
legislation) led, as class taxation always
does, to ingenious evasions and, in
the end, increased the power it sought to
restrict.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Rome, home taxes were suspended
as soon as conquests brought tribute from
Spain and Africa. But taxes were always
the curse of the provinces, and the vexatious
<i>method</i> of the tax “may be regarded
as an additional tax.” “The defects of
the financial organization were a serious
influence in the complex of causes that
brought about the fall of the Republic.”
The early Empire took its revenues from
public lands, from monopolies, from the
land tax, from customs, and from taxes
on inheritances (5%), sales (10%) and
the purchase of slaves (40%). There was
no just distribution of taxation among
the territorial divisions, and the burden
fell too much upon the actual workers and
their employers. In the kingdoms which
succeeded the Empire after its fall, Roman
customs survived in finance, as in
all departments of government; and there
was a want of coherent policy until the
time of Charlemagne, when centralization
produced a better system. But scientific
taxation did not really exist until,
in the 15th century, under Charles VII,
the first French standing army was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>created, and its needs led to a new and
more intelligent system. In England,
the co-ordination and control of public
revenue and expenditure was similarly
due to the growth of the navy. Since
then the tendency has been to include
taxes in general categories; the need for
national credit has developed a system
of national debts; and expenditures and
receipts are now governed by legislative
sanction. Local finance has been revolutionized
by modern business methods, too
slowly adopted it is true, and by the gradual
change from private to public control
of water supply, lighting and transportation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Taxation and Tariff</div>

<p class='c007'>The articles <span class='sc'>Taxation</span>, <span class='sc'>National
Debt</span> and <span class='sc'>Tariff</span> should be read after
this article on public finance. <span class='sc'>Taxation</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 458;
equivalent to 25
pages of this Guide),
by Sir Robert Giffen,
formerly Controller-General of the British
Board of Trade, classifies taxes, points
out that direct and indirect taxes are not
intrinsically different and that such a
classification is merely a matter of convenience,
and the article proceeds to describe
the principal taxes. It should be
supplemented by reading the sections on
finance in the articles on various countries
and especially by the article <span class='sc'>English
Finance</span> (Vol. 9, p. 458; equivalent
to 25 pages in this Guide), the section
on Finance in the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 660) and similar sections in
the articles on each of the states of the
Union. These articles give definite information
about public debts, national or
state, but the student should read carefully
the main treatment in the article
<span class='sc'>National Debt</span> (Vol. 19, p. 266). The
articles <span class='sc'>Tariff</span> (Vol. 26, p. 422), by Prof.
F. W. Taussig of Harvard, author of <i>The
Tariff History of the United States</i>; <span class='sc'>Protection</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 464), by Edmund
Janes James, president of the University
of Illinois and author of the well-known
<i>History of American Tariff Legislation</i>;
and <span class='sc'>Free Trade</span> (Vol. 11, p. 88), by
William Cunningham, author of <i>Growth
of English Industry and Commerce</i>, will be
of great interest. The student should
read besides the sketches in the Britannica
of <span class='sc'>Henry Clay</span> (Vol. 6, p. 470), by
Carl Schurz, of <span class='sc'>William McKinley</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 256), <span class='sc'>Roger Q. Mills</span> (Vol.
18, p. 475), and of other American tariff-leaders,
and, for the tariff reform movement
in England, the articles on <span class='sc'>Joseph
Chamberlain</span> (Vol. 5, p. 813) and <span class='sc'>Arthur
J. Balfour</span> (Vol. 3, p. 250). Before
turning from public to private finance the
reader should study the articles <span class='sc'>Exchequer</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 54) and <span class='sc'>Treasury</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 228).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Private Finance</div>

<p class='c007'>For what may be called <i>private</i> finance,
the student should turn first to the article
<span class='sc'>Banks and Banking</span> (Vol. 3, p. 334;
equivalent to nearly 60
pages in this Guide), by
Sir R. H. I. Palgrave, director
of Barclay &#38; Co.,
Ltd., Bankers; Charles A. Conant, author
of <i>The Principles of Money and Banking</i>;
and Sir J. R. Paget, author of the <i>Law
of Banking</i>. Further information on the
early history of banking in the United
States will be found in the historical
section of the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>
(Vol. 27, especially p. 697), and in the
article <span class='sc'>Andrew Jackson</span> (Vol. 15, p. 107)
by Prof. W. G. Sumner of Yale.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Currency</div>

<p class='c007'>Next in his course of reading, he should
study the article <span class='sc'>Money</span> (Vol. 18, p.
694; equivalent to 45 pages in this Guide),
by C. F. Bastable.
This deals with: the
functions and varieties
of money, including coined money
and all else that can take its place <i>in
facilitating exchange</i>, <i>in estimating comparative
values</i>, <i>as a standard of value</i> or
of <i>deferred payments</i>, as <i>a store of value</i>;
the determining causes of the value of
money and of the quantity of money
required by a country, the credit theory,
early forms of currency—greenstones,
ochre, shells, furs, oxen, grain; metals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>as money; coinage and state control;
representative money, and credit as
money; economic aspects of the production
and consumption of precious
metals; review of the history of some
important currencies—Greek, Roman,
medieval, English and French coinages
are treated in the article <span class='sc'>Numismatics</span>
(Vol. 19, pp. 869–911, equivalent to 135
pages of this Guide, with 6 plates and
11 other text illustrations); which discusses
such questions as the constitution
of money; typical currency systems;
statistics of production of gold and silver
since the discovery of America, and
coinage systems. Other relevant articles
are <span class='sc'>Bimetallism</span>, and <span class='sc'>Monetary Conferences</span>
for the relation of the metals;
and the articles <span class='sc'>Gold</span>, <span class='sc'>Silver</span>, <span class='sc'>Seigniorage</span>,
<span class='sc'>Demonetization</span>, <span class='sc'>Gresham’s Law</span>,
<span class='sc'>Token Money</span> and <span class='sc'>Greenbacks</span>. In
the article on the <span class='sc'>George Junior Republic</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 749), the “children’s
state” at Freeville, N. Y., the student
will find an interesting proof of the relation
of “token” to “real” money. “The
government issued its own currency in
tin and later in aluminium and ‘American’
money could not be passed within the
48 acres of the Republic until 1906,
when depreciation forced the Republic’s
coinage out of use and ‘American’ coin
was made legal tender.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br> <span class='c014'>FOR CIVIL SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN AND STUDENTS PREPARING FOR SERVICE EXAMINATIONS</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Federal, state and municipal
civil service includes so many specialized
branches that a number of
the chapters in Part 1 of this Guide,
devoted to courses of reading adapted
to various occupations (such as <i>For
Teachers</i>, <i>For Engineers</i>, <i>For Builders
and Contractors</i>) will supply useful indications.
Part 2 of the Guide, containing
classified courses of educational
reading, will point to articles especially
serviceable to those who are preparing
for examinations and, for that reason,
desire to review the ground they covered
at school or college.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part 4 of the Guide, with its special
references to the subjects to which administration
and legislation are chiefly
directed, should be carefully examined.
There the reader will find lists of articles
dealing with schools and institutions;
the defective classes; crime and alcohol;
revenue and finance; ballot representation
and suffrage; trusts, competition,
co-operation and socialism; labour and
immigration; legislation and the administration
of justice; foreign relations
and the expansion of the United States.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>International Comparisons</div>

<p class='c007'>The present chapter, in order that
repetition may be avoided, deals only
with the aspects of federal, state and
municipal government which are most
closely related to civil service organization.
The article <span class='sc'>Civil Service</span> (Vol.
6, p. 412) devotes
nearly as much space
to the British as to the
American service,
and its information as to British organization,
examinations, salaries and pensions
will greatly interest those to whom
the details needed for an international
comparison have not been elsewhere
accessible. Until 1855 all British appointments
were by nomination; and
although the service was quite free from
the abominable system of secretly taxing
salaries in order to support party funds,
that was about all that can be said for it.
There was hardly a pretense of selection
for merit. Influential families and the
relatives and personal friends of ministers
of state and of ladies whom kings
delighted to honor monopolized the appointments.
Many posts were pure
sinecures, and in many others the work
was done by a substitute to whom the
nominee paid less than half the salary or
fees he received. Under George III the
system was at its worst, and the discontent
that was aroused in the American
colonies by the maladministration of
colonial affairs was “one of the efficient
causes of the American revolution.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>The reforms begun in 1855 had by 1870
been so successful that since then open
competition has been the general rule;
and where nomination is still required,
as in the Foreign Office and the Education
Department, searching examinations
must be passed. Women are employed
in the post-office, board of agriculture,
customs, India office, department
of agriculture, local government
board and home office (factory inspectors,
etc.). The age for compulsory
retirement is 65, but the commissioners
may prolong this five years in exceptional
cases. Subjects of examinations,
salaries and pensions are described in
the article. Since 1859 there has been
a superannuation pension of ¹⁰⁄₆₀ of
the annual salary and emoluments to
any one serving 10 years and less than
11, and an additional sixtieth for each
year’s service more than ten.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Civil Service in the United States</div>

<p class='c007'>In the same article there is an historical
treatment of civil service in the United
States and of its gradual reform and extension
since 1883.
This may well be
supplemented by a
study of the American
party system of
government and of the “spoils system”
under which party loyalty and personal
service to a party machine became the
test of a candidate’s fitness for office.
For this the student should refer to the
section (Vol. 27, p. 646) on <i>Constitution
and Government</i>, of the article <span class='sc'>United
States</span>, written by James Bryce, author
of <i>The American Commonwealth</i> and
formerly British ambassador to the United
States; see p. 658–659, especially. There
is also much information in the section
<i>History</i> of the same article, especially
paragraphs 168, 169 (p. 697) on the beginnings
of the spoils system in Jackson’s
time, paragraph 333 (p. 722) on the beginnings
of reform under Hayes, and paragraph
343 (p. 724) on Cleveland and
civil service reform, etc.; and biographies
of Andrew Jackson, W. L. Marcy and
Martin Van Buren (for the spoils system)
and of George William Curtis, E. L.
Godkin, Carl Schurz, R. B. Hayes,
Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison,
William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Information in regard to the civil
service systems of states and cities may
be found in separate state and city
articles,—in addition to the material
on state and city systems in the articles
already mentioned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“General Information” Papers</div>

<p class='c007'>The wide-awake student who has
read this far in this chapter and has
referred to the articles mentioned in
the Britannica, will
now be saying to
himself: “There is
evidently much valuable
information in
the encyclopaedia about the history and
status of civil service reform, and this
seems as full and complete for the United
States as for Great Britain. If other
topics are as fully treated in the Britannica,
it will be invaluable to me in preparation
for general information papers
for civil service examinations.” And
he will be right. For instance, the
government employe must know more
about the government and its machinery
and history than does the average “man
in the street”,—and he can learn this
from the Britannica.</p>

<p class='c007'>As has already been pointed out,
the main treatment of the government
of the United States in the Britannica
is by James Bryce. This means that it
is authoritative and that it is interesting
and that in both these qualities
it is far superior to the usual text book
of “civics” or “civil government.” It
occupies pp. 646–661 of volume 27, and
is equivalent to about 50 pages of this
Guide—so that it is more than a bare
outline. And it is followed by a valuable
bibliography of the subject to guide
the student to the best books on any
special topic which he may wish to
pursue further.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>But this is far from being all the information
in the Britannica on the subject.
The contribution of Mr. Bryce
is only a part of the article <span class='sc'>United
States</span>. The entire article would take up
nearly 400 pages if printed in the style
of this Guide. It treats the physical
geography, geology, climate, fauna and
flora, population, industries and commerce,
government, finance, army and
history of the country—the equivalent
of 225 pages of this Guide is devoted to
<i>History</i> alone. All parts of this article
contain valuable information about the
country; and this article is supplemented
by hundreds of others:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(a) Articles on each of the states,
arranged much as in the article <span class='sc'>United
States</span> with sections on history and government
serving as an authoritative
summary of the salient facts, and making
up a complete course on state “civics,”
government and history;</p>

<p class='c007'>(b) Articles on cities and towns with
similar treatment of the distinctive
elements in the government of each, and
of the main points in their history;</p>

<p class='c007'>(c) Separate articles on the important
rivers, lakes, mountains and other topics
in physical geography;</p>

<p class='c007'>(d) Separate articles on topics in
American history and government: such
as <span class='sc'>Nullification</span>, <span class='sc'>State Rights</span>, <span class='sc'>Fugitive
Slave Laws</span>, <span class='sc'>Electoral Commission</span>;
and</p>

<p class='c007'>(e) Biographies of great Americans,
famous in war, politics, administration,
business, science, art, religion,—in short
all fields of activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>In brief, whether for an examination
on general information, on civics, on
history, or on the special branch of the
civil service to which the student wishes
to be appointed, no book will give as
valuable and complete information as
the Britannica.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIX<br> <span class='c014'>FOR ARMY OFFICERS</span></h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>A New Departure</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>It is often said of an article in the
Britannica that it is “<i>the last word</i> on
the subject,” so thoroughly has the
authority of the book been recognized.
This is quite as true of military articles
as of those in any other field; but of the
military articles it may also be said that
they are the <i>first word</i>. Of course, there
have been, in previous
editions of the
Britannica and, to a
less degree in minor
works of general reference, articles on
military history and biography. But in
the new Britannica, for the first time, all
branches of military knowledge are included,
and the spirit of the entire treatment
is comparative and critical. The
military student will find a discussion not
merely of Napoleon’s influence on army
organization or Frederick’s influence on
cavalry (in the articles on these two
leaders), but also of the influence of army
organization on Napoleon (in the articles
on the French Revolutionary Wars and
the Napoleonic Campaigns), and of cavalry
drill on the peculiar generalship of
Frederick (in such articles as Seven
Years’ War, on Hohenfriedberg, and on
Rossbach). Put more concretely, the
novelty consists in the inclusion of articles
on wars, campaigns and battles,
chosen because of their importance in
military as well as in political history,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and treated from the point of view of the
military critic and with particular attention
to the lessons they contain for the
modern army officer. The care with
which the battles and campaigns of the
American Civil War are analyzed and
criticized will be of singularly great interest
to the American soldier, who will
immediately notice among the contributors
to the military department of the
Britannica such names as those of Capt.
C. F. Atkinson, author of <i>The Wilderness
and Cold Harbour</i>, Major G. W. Redway,
author of <i>Fredericksburg: A Study in War</i>,
Col. G. F. R. Henderson, author of <i>Stonewall
Jackson and the American Civil War</i>,
and Col. F. N. Maude, lecturer in military
history, University of Manchester.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Army</div>

<p class='c007'>The best starting point for a study of
military affairs in the Britannica
is the article <span class='sc'>Army</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 592; equivalent
to more than 100 pages of this Guide).
This “key” article may be outlined as
follows:</p>

<p class='c020'><i>General History</i></p>

<p class='c020'>Early Armies—<i>Egypt</i> (chariots, infantry,
archers). <i>Babylon</i> and <i>Assyria</i>
(horsemen, charioteers, etc.).
<i>Persian</i>, largely cavalry; the first “organized”
army. <i>Greece</i>,—compulsory
service; citizen militia; heavy infantry
the strong arm; phalanx, the Greek
formation. <i>Sparta</i>,—a nation in arms.
<i>Greek</i> mercenaries. <i>Epaminondas</i> and
<i>Thebes</i>—new phalanx tactics, “oblique
order”; development of cavalry. <i>Alexander</i>
and <i>Macedon</i>—a modified Theban
system. <i>Carthage</i>—mercenary
troops led by great generals, with modification
of phalanx for greater elasticity.
<i>Rome</i>—army under the Republic;
its characteristics; under the Empire;
see also separate article <span class='sc'>Roman
Army</span> (Vol. 23, p. 471), by Professor
F. J. Haverfield of Oxford. <i>The Dark
Ages</i>, the Byzantines, and the development
of Feudalism. Medieval Mercenaries.
Infantry in Feudal Times.
<i>The Crusades</i>. <i>The Period of Transition</i>
(1290–1490), development of English
archers and of professional soldiery,—<i>condottieri</i>,
<i>Swiss</i>, <i>Landsknechts</i>.
<i>The Spanish army</i>: “at the
disposal of its sovereign, trained to the
due professional standard and organized
in the best way found by experience.”

<p class='c007'>Next in order the student should turn
to the article <span class='sc'>War</span> (Vol. 28, p. 305;
equivalent to 40 pages of this Guide), by
Col. G. F. R. Henderson,
well known
for his books on the
American Civil War
(<i>Fredericksburg</i>, <i>Stonewall Jackson</i>, etc.),
with a section on <i>Laws of War</i>, by Sir
Thomas Barclay. Col. Henderson’s article
lays down important general principles.
An analysis of modern conditions
shows that improved methods of communication
have made war a much speedier
process, in which the victorious general
cannot make mistakes at the outset.
That intellect and education count for
more than stamina and courage was the
lesson of the Franco-Prussian War—a
lesson learned by the Prussians before
that war. Modern war is a science and
the amateur has little chance; in this
respect things have changed. “It is impossible
to doubt that had the Boers of
1899 possessed a staff of trained strategists,
they would have shaken the British
Empire to its foundations.” There must
be a concert between diplomacy and
strategy. Civilian war ministers cannot
solve strategic problems. The greater
deadliness of modern warfare, and the
greater moral effect of being under fire
call for better foresight, strategy and
<i>morale</i>. The relation of army and navy
is discussed and the new doctrine of “sea-power”
explained. (See the chapter <i>For
Naval Officers</i> in this Guide). The remaining
topics in the article are: weakness
of allied armies; railways and sea as
lines of operation; amphibious power;
value of unprofessional troops and the
need of professional leaders.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arms of Service</div>

<p class='c007'>In the articles <span class='sc'>Infantry</span> (Vol. 14, p.
517; 2 plates; equivalent to 35 pages of
this Guide) and <span class='sc'>Artillery</span> (Vol. 2, p.
685; 2 plates; equivalent to 30 pages of
this Guide), both by
Capt. Atkinson, and
in the article <span class='sc'>Cavalry</span> (Vol. 5, p. 563;
illustrated with 2 plates and 1 cut; in
length equivalent to 30 pages of this
Guide), by Col. F. N. Maude, the
student will find an elaborate treatment
of the history, organization and tactics
(especially since 1870) of each of these
arms. For details of their organization
and equipment he should read the
articles <span class='sc'>Engineers</span>, <span class='sc'>Staff</span>, <span class='sc'>Mounted
Infantry</span>, <span class='sc'>Supply and Transport (Military)</span>,
<span class='sc'>Officers</span>, <span class='sc'>Ambulance</span>, <span class='sc'>Fortification</span>,
<span class='sc'>Machine Guns</span>, <span class='sc'>Coast Defence</span>,
<span class='sc'>Ordnance</span>, <span class='sc'>Ballistics</span>, <span class='sc'>Sights</span>,
<span class='sc'>Rifle</span>, <span class='sc'>Gun</span>, <span class='sc'>Pistol</span>, <span class='sc'>Explosive</span>, <span class='sc'>Gunpowder</span>,
<span class='sc'>Guncotton</span>, <span class='sc'>Cordite</span> and
<span class='sc'>Nitro-glycerine</span>. In many geographical
articles there are descriptions of the
world’s great fortifications, e. g., <i>Paris</i>,
<i>Antwerp</i>, and <i>Verdun</i>. Other topics
of a more miscellaneous character are
covered by the articles <span class='sc'>Army Signalling</span>,
<span class='sc'>Pigeon Post</span>, <span class='sc'>Signals</span>, <span class='sc'>War Game</span>,
<span class='sc'>Manoeuvres</span>, <span class='sc'>Kite</span>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>The military use of aeroplanes and
balloons is very fully shown in the articles
<span class='sc'>Flight</span> and <span class='sc'>Aeronautics</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strategy and Tactics</div>

<p class='c007'>Before taking up a systematic course
in military history, there are two general
articles that the military student should
read: <span class='sc'>Tactics</span> (Vol.
26, p. 347; equivalent
in length to 20
pages of this Guide),
by Maj. Neill Malcolm, editor of the
<i>Science of War</i>; and <span class='sc'>Strategy</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 986; equivalent to 35 pages of this
Guide), by Col. F. N. Maude. The
former article should be compared with
the sections on tactics in the articles
<span class='sc'>Infantry</span>, <span class='sc'>Cavalry</span> and <span class='sc'>Artillery</span>.
Major Malcolm makes much of the continuity
of military history, comparing
Metaurus and Ramillies with the fighting
in Manchuria, and Wellington at Maya
with Oyama in his contest with Kuropatkin.
The mistakes that have been
made once should not be made again;
at least the careful student of tactical
history may see to it that if they are
repeated, it is done by his opponent and
not by himself. Modern tactics are
different from ancient because of greater
fire-power and improved methods of
transportation. Cavalry tactics are in
an uncertain condition; there is no recent
practice to serve as a guide, since neither
in South Africa in the Boer war nor in
Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese
conflict was cavalry much used. Infantry
must co-operate to make artillery
bombardment effective. An interesting
discussion of offensive and defensive
fighting is summed up in the words
“To the true general the purely defensive
battle is unknown” and as evidence
are adduced Wellington at Salamanca
and Oyama at Sha-ho. Oyama’s victory
in the latter battle, it is pointed out,
shows the increased ease of the process
of envelopment, which has resulted in
discarding corps artillery in favour of
divisional artillery. The importance—and
the possibility—of the counter stroke;
the danger of using for the relief of one’s
own troops forces which might better
be launched at the enemy’s weakest
spot; and the similar unwisdom of any
negative tactics, adopted to avoid loss,
as in “holding attacks”—are the other
principal points made in the article.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Strategy</span> should be read
in conjunction with the articles <span class='sc'>Army</span>
and <span class='sc'>War</span>. It is impossible to summarize
or outline it here, but it is worth noting
that the article closes with a definition
and discussion of the following terms:
<i>Base</i>; <i>Line of Communication</i>; <i>Line of
Operations</i>; <i>Exterior Lines</i>; <i>Obstacles</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Military Encyclopaedia</div>

<p class='c007'>The military student will see from
what has already been said that the Britannica
is not merely a general work of
reference but a valuable
aid in the study
of military history,
biography, theory,
practice and phraseology. The following
alphabetical list names only the chief
of the articles in the Britannica which
make it a military cyclopaedia. As has
been noticed above, many articles are
special treatises in themselves dealing
with many related topics, and—for instance—articles
on wars or campaigns
contain elaborate descriptions of separate
battles. Many topics are treated in the
Britannica, even if they are not in the
following list, and their whereabouts
may be readily learned by turning to
the Index volume.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXX<br> <span class='c014'>FOR NAVAL OFFICERS</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The scope of a naval officer’s professional
interests is so broad that
the present chapter of this Guide
could not, without duplicating other
chapters, indicate all the aspects of the
Britannica with which he is directly concerned.
And he will find that his use of
the Britannica is simplified by the subdivisions
about to be specified, which virtually
present his subjects under four different
heads. Of course he may be called
upon, in the exercise of his duties, simultaneously
to think and to act in all his
capacities, to concentrate upon the swift
solution of one problem his knowledge of
warfare, of shipbuilding, of navigation
and of mechanical engineering; but his
reading upon these topics naturally divides
itself into these four parts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Three Other Relevant Chapters</div>

<p class='c007'>Inasmuch as army officers, even when
they are at sea, are passengers, and, save
in relation to the discipline of their troops,
have nothing to do
with the ship’s management,
it could not
be assumed that the
present chapter
would appeal to them. But naval officers,
when co-operating in a land expedition,
need to employ every kind of knowledge
that is of use to army officers, and as the
chapter <i>For Army Officers</i> in this Guide
would therefore in any case be read by
them, it has seemed convenient to include
in it the description of those articles in
the Britannica which deal with war in
general.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chapter <i>For Marine Transportation
Men</i> in this Guide is also one to
which the naval officer should refer, as it
deals with ships and navigation in general.
The articles <span class='sc'>Ship</span> and <span class='sc'>Shipbuilding</span>
mentioned in that chapter are (except
for the historical section of the former)
by Sir Philip Watts, designer of the
British “Dreadnoughts” and “Super-Dreadnoughts;”
and the article <span class='sc'>Shipping</span>
is by Douglas Owen, of the Royal Naval
War College at Portsmouth. Obviously
these and many other articles described
in that chapter are of the greatest importance
to naval officers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chapter <i>For Engineers</i> in this
Guide describes the articles dealing with
steam engines, internal combustion engines,
electrical machinery and fuels of
all kinds; and it would be a waste of space
to repeat in this chapter a summary of
the Britannica treatment of these subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>All three of the chapters mentioned
should therefore be treated as forming
constituent parts of the general plan of
this present chapter, in which the naval
officer will find no repetition of their
contents.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Key Article</div>

<p class='c007'>The article to which he will naturally
first turn is <span class='sc'>Navy and Navies</span> (Vol. 19,
p. 299), by David Hannay,
author of <i>A Short History
of the Royal Navy</i>. This
article is equivalent to 60
pages of this Guide in length. It contains:</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span><i>Naval Personnel.</i></p>

<p class='c020'>Sketches of the <i>Administrative History
of navies</i>: <i>Athenian</i>; <i>Roman</i>; <i>Byzantine</i>;
<i>Medieval</i>; <i>British</i>, with special
attention to the period since the
Restoration, and the reforms under
James II when Samuel Pepys was secretary;</p>

<p class='c020'><i>French</i>—modern navy dating from
the time of Richelieu;</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Spanish</i>—a great navy without an
organization before the 18th century;</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Dutch</i>—good seamen and well-fed,
led by able admirals, but unorganized,
and unimportant after the 17th century;</p>

<p class='c020'><i>United States</i>—the first great extra-European
power on the sea;</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Russian</i>—dating from the reign of
Peter the Great, when it was organized
and led by foreigners.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>The Balance of Navies in History</i>:
influence of sea-power—“when Napoleon
fell, the navy of Great Britain was
not merely the first in the world; it was
the only powerful navy in existence.”
<i>Modern Rivalry</i> between Italy and
Germany (1871), United States
(1890), Japan; England and the Dual
Alliance—“naval scares” since 1874;
British Naval Defence Act of 1889;
Russia’s navy crushed (1904); new navies
rivalling Great Britain and
France,—Italy, Germany, United
States, Japan.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Latest developments</i>: “Dreadnoughts”;
Building Programmes.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Bibliography</i> (about 1800 words).</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Naval Strategy and Tactics</i>.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Historical evolution</i>: inter-relation of
the ship’s capacity and armament.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Early history</i>: ramming demanded
oars for propulsion; small warships,
large fighting crews,—no blockade,
short cruises;</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Greek and Roman methods</i>: boarding
introduced by Romans; “bearding,”
that is, fortifying with iron bands
across the bows, an early form of armor
plate.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Sailing ships</i>: ramming discarded;
“line ahead” formation displaces “line
abreast”; principles of fighting tactics—order
at beginning to be kept
throughout, thus no advantage taken of
enemy’s disorder; Clerk’s theories
(1790–97)—not maximum safety but
immediate mêlée the <i>desideratum</i>; Suffren,
Rodney and Howe and their disregard
of accepted tactics.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Improved shipbuilding and modern
times</i>: New problems—steam propulsion,
its gain in speed, but its dependence
on fuel; fleet in being; risk of
transporting troops while enemy is unbeaten;
ramming and pell-mell battles
forbidden by torpedoes; searchlight as
check to torpedoes; failure of attempts
to “bottle up” harbours; gun-fire still
the great factor; position; speed; submarines
still an unknown factor.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Bibliography</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Naval Administration</div>

<p class='c007'>The first part of this article <span class='sc'>Navy and
Navies</span> should be supplemented by the
article <span class='sc'>Admiralty Administration</span> (Vol.
1, p. 195), by Admiral
Sir R. Vesey Hamilton,
and, for the
United States, the
late Admiral W. T. Sampson. The American
part of this article describes the divisions
and the working of the Navy Department,
its bureaus, judge advocate-general,
office of naval intelligence, boards
etc.; and there is additional information
on the subject in such articles as <span class='sc'>Dockyards</span>,
and <span class='sc'>United States Naval Academy</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the legal side of naval administration
the reader should study the article
<span class='sc'>Admiralty Jurisdiction</span> (Vol. 1, p. 205),
by Sir Walter Phillimore, former president
of the International Law Association
(and author of the Britannica article
<span class='sc'>Admiralty, High Court of</span>), and, for the
United States, by J. Arthur Barrett; and
also the general articles <span class='sc'>International
Law</span> (Vol. 14, p. 694), by Sir Thomas
Barclay, author of <i>Problems of International
Practice and Diplomacy</i>, and <span class='sc'>International
Law, Private</span> (Vol. 14, p. 701),
by Dr. John Westlake, formerly professor
of international law, Cambridge University,
and member for the United Kingdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of the International (Hague) Court
of Arbitration; as well as such special
articles as <span class='sc'>Search</span> (Vol. 24, p. 560), by
Sir Thomas Barclay, and <span class='sc'>Sea Laws</span> (Vol.
24, p. 535), by Sir Travers Twiss.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Policy, Strategy, Tactics</div>

<p class='c007'>It has already been noticed that the
closing part of the article <span class='sc'>Navy and
Navies</span> dealt with strategy and tactics in
a general way. This subject
is treated in fuller detail
by Admiral Sir Cyprian
Bridge, G.C.B. (former Director
of Naval Intelligence,
British Navy, author of <i>Sea-Power and
other Studies</i>) in two articles <span class='sc'>Sea-Power</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 548) and <span class='sc'>Sea, Command of
the</span> (Vol. 24, p. 529). Each of these articles
will be of great value and interest
to the naval officer as a summary and
criticism of the theories of Captain A. T.
Mahan and Vice-Admiral P. H. Colomb;
and this will be made evident by the brief
outline of the two articles which follows.</p>

<p class='c020'>Article, <span class='sc'>Sea-Power</span>—Use of the
term to mean (1) a state pre-eminently
strong at sea; and (2)—as in this
article—the various factors in a state’s
naval strength. Thucydides as a forerunner
of Mahan; he makes Pericles in
comparing Athenian resources with
those of her enemies comment on the
importance of “sea-power.”</p>

<p class='c020'>The meaning of sea-power can only
be learned historically. Although there
have been more land-wars, “the course
of history has been profoundly changed
more often by contests on the water.”
Salamis saved Greece and held back
Oriental invasion. The loss of the
Peloponnesian War by Athens was due
to her weakening sea-power. The
First Punic War, Roman rather than
Carthaginian control of the Mediterranean,
was won by Roman naval predominance.
Mahommedan conquest
spread west in Africa only with the
creation of a navy. The crusades could
not have continued had not Mahommedan
naval power sunk as the Venetian,
Pisan, and Genoese grew. The defeat
of Genoa by Venice gave the latter a
right to perform the ceremony of
“wedding the sea” with a ring as
token of “perpetual sway.” Lepanto
(1571) the end of Turkish sea-power.</p>

<p class='c020'>Spanish and Portuguese sea-power
crushed by English growth and the
loss of the Armada. Early English
naval history: the importance of the
battle of Dover in 1217. Appearance
of standing navies. The New World
and its influence on sea-power. The
sea-power of the Dutch; its sudden
rise; its basis in foreign trade; the
Dutch wars with England resulted in
England’s becoming the first great
naval power, but did not crush the
United Provinces because of their sea-power.
Torrington and the “Fleet in
Being” in 1690. Change in naval operations
in 17th century—the scene
thereafter in the enemy’s waters, not
near the coast of England.</p>

<p class='c020'>The 18th century. Rise of Russia’s
sea-power—an artificial creation.
Seven Years’ War and its gains to
Great Britain. War of American Independence:
British mistakes—the
enemy’s coast <i>not</i> considered the frontier.
Wars of the French Revolution
and Empire: Great Britain’s advantage
not in organization, discipline or “science,”
but in sea-experience.</p>

<p class='c020'>The War of 1812. “The British
had now to meet the <i>élite</i> of one of the
finest communities of seamen ever
known.... In any future war British
sea-power, great as it may be, should
not receive shocks like those that it unquestionably
did suffer in 1812.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Later Manifestations of Sea-Power.
American Civil War—“By dominating
the rivers the Federals cut the Confederacy
asunder; and, by the power
they possessed of moving troops by sea
at will, perplexed and harassed the defence,
and facilitated the occupation of
important points.” Russo-Turkish War
of 1877–78—Turkish control of Black
Sea forced Russians to invade by land
through the difficult Balkans. Chilean
Civil War of 1891—an army defeated
by a navy. Chino-Japanese War of
1894–95—Japanese navy in transport
work and in crushing last resistance.
Spanish-American War: “Spaniards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>were defeated by the superiority of the
American sea-power.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Article, <span class='sc'>Sea, Command of the</span>—Sketch
of Sovereignty of the Sea;
Command different from Sovereignty
or Dominion.</p>

<p class='c020'>Attempts to gain Command: Dutch
Wars.</p>

<p class='c020'>Strategic Command or Control—largely
the power of carrying out considerable
over-sea expeditions at will.
Seeking the enemy’s fleet. Temporary
command in smaller operations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Special Historical Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>As for the army officer, so the Britannica
has for the naval officer many separate
articles on wars, campaigns, battles,

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The general articles on music in
the Encyclopaedia Britannica provide
an illuminative discussion
of broad artistic principles which cannot
fail to stimulate the musical sense
and perception of the professional or
the amateur. The technical and critical
treatment of the subject was directed
by Donald F. Tovey, composer,
pianist, and author of <i>Essays in Musical
Analysis</i>; and no one could be
better fitted for the work of organizing
this department of the Britannica. He
was assisted by W. H. Hadow, the well-known
musical writer and composer,
J. A. Fuller Maitland, musical critic of
<i>The Times</i> (London), E. J. Dent, author
of <i>Alessandro Scarlatti and His Works</i>,
R. H. Legge, principal musical critic on
the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (London), and others;
and the section treating of musical instruments
was organized and contributed
by Miss Kathleen Schlesinger, the greatest
living authority on the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>In mapping out courses of reading
the subject is divided into sections as
follows: (1) Evolution, (2) Theory,
(3) Musical Forms, (4) Musical Instruments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Music</span> (Vol. 19, p. 72),
by Donald Tovey, which contains a masterly
account of the development of the
art from the earliest time down to the
present day, provides the reader with
just that general survey which enables
him to see the whole picture in perspective.
This he will naturally turn to first,
but to fill out the picture there are a
number of other articles which he will
wish to read. In the following scheme
the evolution of the art has been sketched
in skeleton, so that the student may
have before him a guide to the study of
any period in which he is specially
interested. This outline serves to show
how very thoroughly the ground is covered
in the new Encyclopaedia Britannica.</p>

<p class='c007'>Composers were not long content with the simple combination of two tunes.
They soon found that three tunes so treated afforded a yet richer texture, and the
extension to the elaborate polyphony of 16th century choral music was an inevitable
step. An elaborate system of prohibitions, based on the limitations
of the human voice, and the difficulty of attacking certain
intervals, shackled the composer at every turn and formed the
basis of theories of counterpoint which endured almost to our
time. Despite the restrictions imposed by their rules, the structure raised by the
great composers of the first half of the 16th century was of amazing richness and
complexity.</p>

inevitable, too far. A reaction was equally inevitable, for the language of the new

was needed to prepare the way for the colossal achievement of
a Bach or a Beethoven. It was a busy period when the rules
of counterpoint were reviewed and revised, when theories of
harmony as a distinct science took shape. But, save for the work of such men as
Purcell, the Englishman (Vol. 22, p. 658), born 100 years before his time, the 17th
century was mainly one of preparation. The next great climax came in the first
half of the 18th century.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><i>THE RISE OF THE SONATA</i></h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Third Great Climax</div>

<p class='c007'>Bach, like Palestrina, seemed to have closed a period; and for nearly a hundred
years after his death his influence on the course of musical development was astonishingly
small. Again men sought new channels of expression and found them in instrumental
music. But a structure less loosely knit than the
suite form was needed if the new ideas were to be adequately
stated, and the sonata grew into being, a form which has sufficed
to this day as a medium for the noblest thoughts of the great
composers. The 18th century saw, too, the reform of the opera by Gluck, a great
development of orchestral resources, and the rise of the string quartette in chamber
music.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><i>NEW PATHS</i></h4>

<p class='c017'>Early in the 19th century the wave of romanticism broke over Europe. The
effect on music was not nearly so violent as was the monodic revolt of the 16th–17th
centuries, since the resources and technique of the art had now been developed;
but it was nevertheless striking and showed itself in several directions, but mainly
in two: lyrical and dramatic. The short compositions of Field, Schumann, and
Chopin, and the development of the art song are instances of the former; the whole
range of programme music, of which the symphonic poem is the prototype, is evidence
of the latter; while in opera the reforms started by Gluck were carried to their
logical conclusion by Wagner. Two other movements are also significant; the return
to Bach and a recognition of his amazing modernity, and the pronounced revival
of national characteristics in music, as shown particularly in the new English, Russian,
and Bohemian Schools.</p>

  <h4 class='c016'>(2) THEORETICAL ARTICLES</h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“In the beginning,” said Hans von
Bülow, “was rhythm,” and as <span class='sc'>Rhythm</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 277) is the skeleton of every
musical phrase and formula, the interesting
article by Donald Tovey on
rhythm in music may well serve as an
introduction to the other subjects in
this section. Passing to the elements,
the articles <span class='sc'>Sound</span>, <i>Diatonic Scale</i> (Vol.
25, p. 448) and <span class='sc'>Plain Song</span> (Vol. 21,
p. 705) should be read. In the former
article the physical basis of the modern
scale is determined, while in the latter
an account is given of the modes which
for centuries were the vehicles of musical
expression. In the article <span class='sc'>Musical Notation</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 86) the steps by which
the present system of recording music
was reached are noted, and in <span class='sc'>Pitch,
Musical</span> (Vol. 21, p. 660), the whole of
this interesting and vexed subject is
reviewed by Alfred J. Hipkins, a high
authority, formerly hon. curator of the
Royal College of Music. The article
<span class='sc'>Melody</span> (Vol. 18, p. 96) contains in
addition to a discussion of the terms
a series of useful definitions (e.g., conjunct
and disjunct motion) and several
musical examples. This brings us to
the main articles of this section—<span class='sc'>Counterpoint</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 315), <span class='sc'>Harmony</span> (Vol.
13, p. 1) and <span class='sc'>Instrumentation</span> (Vol. 14,
p. 651). All are by Donald Tovey and
all are brilliant. In particular the article
<span class='sc'>Harmony</span> deserves the most careful
study, especially interesting being the
sections <i>Tonality</i> and <i>Key-relationship</i>.
The article on counterpoint is mainly
a definition of the principles involved
and is introductory both to Harmony
and to Contrapuntal Forms. In <span class='sc'>Instrumentation</span>
the question of colour
is discussed from the historical and
aesthetic aspects, accompanied by valuable
analysis of the colour schemes of
various composers from the choral writers
of the “Golden Age” down to Wagner
and Richard Strauss.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theorists</div>

<p class='c020'>Famous theorists who have helped to
establish the grammar of music are the
following: <span class='sc'>Terpander</span>, 7th century B.C.,
founder of Greek music
(Vol. 26, p. 647); <span class='sc'>Pythagoras</span>,
6th century, B.C., said
to have discovered numerical relation governing
the harmonic series (Vol. 22, p.
699); <span class='sc'>Alypius</span>, 3rd century B.C. (Vol. 1,
p. 776); <span class='sc'>Aristides, Quintilianus</span>, 3rd
century A.D.; <span class='sc'>Hucbald</span>, c. 840–930, inventor
of new notation (Vol. 13, p. 847);
<span class='sc'>Guido of Arezzo</span>, c. 995–1050, “Beatus
Guido, inventor musicae,” (Vol. 12, p.
687); <span class='sc'>Agricola, Martin</span>, c. 1500–1556;
<span class='sc'>Zarlino, G.</span>, 1517–1590, fixed the diatonic
scale; <span class='sc'>Artusi, G. M.</span>, 16th century, opposed
monodist revolt; <span class='sc'>Fux, J. J.</span>, wrote
the famous <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i>, <span class='sc'>Rameau,
J. P.</span>, 1683–1764, to whom the first
systematic theory of harmony is due; <span class='sc'>Albrechtsberger,
J. G.</span>, 1736–1809, the
teacher of Beethoven; <span class='sc'>Reicha, A. J.</span>,
1770–1836; <span class='sc'>Richter, E. F. E.</span>, 1808–1879;
<span class='sc'>Curwen, J.</span>, 1817–1880, inventor of
tonic sol-fa system; <span class='sc'>Berlioz Hector</span>,
whose text book on instrumentation is
classic. On all these separate articles will
be found in the Britannica.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>(3) MUSICAL FORMS</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Contrapuntal Forms</div>

<p class='c007'>In making a detailed study of any
particular form, reference should be made
to the critical sections
of the biographies
of those masters
who have done most
towards its development. As has been
seen in the historical section of this
chapter, the <span class='sc'>Contrapuntal Forms</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 41) were the first to attain to
a high standard of organization in the
hands of such masters as <span class='sc'>Orlando
Lasso</span> (Vol. 16, p. 237) and <span class='sc'>Palestrina</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 627). The articles <span class='sc'>Mass</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>(Vol. 17, p. 849), <span class='sc'>Motet</span> (Vol. 18, p. 905),
<span class='sc'>Madrigal</span> (Vol. 17, p. 295), <span class='sc'>Canon</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 190), <span class='sc'>Chorale</span> (Vol. 6, p. 269),
cover the ground of early choral music.
In tracing their development reference
should be made to the articles on <span class='sc'>Bach,
J. S.</span> (Vol. 3, p. 127), <span class='sc'>Beethoven</span> (Vol. 3,
p. 649), <span class='sc'>Brahms</span> (Vol. 4, p. 390). <span class='sc'>Oratorio</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 161) and <span class='sc'>Cantata</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 209) had their beginning in
the work of the followers of Monteverde
in the early 17th century, and their
development may be traced in the work
of <span class='sc'>Cavaliere</span> (Vol. 5, p. 563), <span class='sc'>Carissimi</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 338), <span class='sc'>Purcell</span> (Vol. 22, p. 658),
<span class='sc'>Bach</span> (Vol. 3, p. 127), <span class='sc'>Handel</span> (Vol. 2,
p. 912), <span class='sc'>Brahms</span> (Vol. 4 p. 390), <span class='sc'>César
Franck</span> (Vol. 11, p. 3), and <span class='sc'>Sir C.
Hubert Parry</span> (Vol. 20, p. 865).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Suite and Sonata</div>

<p class='c007'>In instrumental music, the <span class='sc'>Suite</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 51), of which <span class='sc'>Boccherini</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 105) was the last master, most
nearly foreshadowed
the Sonata (<span class='sc'>Sonata
Forms</span>, Vol. 25, p.
394), and together
they tell the tale of the development of
absolute music up to modern experiments
in the more elastic <span class='sc'>Symphonic
Poem</span> (Vol. 26, p. 289) of which <span class='sc'>Liszt</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 780) was the first to see the
possibilities. In addition to the articles
<span class='sc'>Sonata</span> and <span class='sc'>Sonata Forms</span> the reader
should carefully study that part of the
article <span class='sc'>Beethoven</span> beginning on page
647 of Vol. 3; also the article <span class='sc'>Harmony</span>,
<i>Key Relationships</i> (Vol. 13, p. 5) which
contains analyses of several striking key
systems, and further reference should
also be made to the articles <span class='sc'>Variations</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 912), <span class='sc'>Symphony</span> (Vol. 26,
p. 290).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Programme Music</div>

<p class='c007'>To the Romantic movement of the
early part of the 19th century may be
traced the attempt to escape from the
apparent restrictions
of the Sonata Form,
and <span class='sc'>Schumann’s</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 384) many
<i>Fantasie-Stücke</i> and <span class='sc'>Chopin’s</span> lyrical
compositions (Vol. 6, p. 268) are prototypes
in little of the tendencies of the
time. On a larger canvas are the Ton-dramen
of Liszt and the symphonic
poems and the elaborate programme
music of modern composers such as
<span class='sc'>Richard Strauss</span> (Vol. 25, p. 1003);
and though <span class='sc'>Brahms</span> (Vol. 4, p. 389)
showed clearly enough that the classical
sonata form was a framework sufficiently
elastic to hold the most elaborate and
modern ideas, the direction in which
music has tended is towards the Symphonic
Poem in which, by such devices
as the transformation of themes and
the <i>Leitmotif</i> (<span class='sc'>Opera</span>, Vol. 20, p. 125)
a still greater elasticity is sought in form
with a greater continuity of idea in
substance. See <span class='sc'>Programme Music</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 424).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Opera</div>

<p class='c007'>Supplementing the article <span class='sc'>Opera</span> (Vol.
20, p. 121) are several which should be
consulted. <span class='sc'>Aria</span> (Vol. 2, p. 489), <span class='sc'>Overture</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 384), and
especially <span class='sc'>Gluck</span> (Vol. 12, p.
139), <span class='sc'>Mozart</span> (Vol. 18, p.
951), <span class='sc'>Weber</span> (Vol. 28, p. 457), and
<span class='sc'>Wagner</span> (Vol. 28, p. 237). These, with
the biographical notices of operatic composers,
which include almost every Italian
composer from the days of <span class='sc'>Peri</span> (Vol. 21,
p. 144), and French composers from
<span class='sc'>Lully</span> (Vol. 17, p. 121), give a mass of
information bearing on the development
of this popular form.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Song</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Song</span> (Vol. 25, p. 400), the oldest of
art forms, and almost the last to be
rescued from the too narrow formalism
of which the classical <span class='sc'>Aria</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 489) is the beautiful
example, is so much the
most generally popular that the article
on it in the Britannica will probably
be more widely read than any other on
musical subjects. Written by W. A. J.
Ford, a scholarly musician and teacher
of singing at the Royal College of Music
(London), it provides a brilliant survey
of the evolution of the song from its
earliest beginnings. In connection with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>it the reader will find much to interest
him in the biographical notices of two
famous troubadours of the 13th and 14th
centuries, <span class='sc'>Adam de la Hale</span> (Vol. 1,
p. 171) and <span class='sc'>Machaut, G. De</span> (Vol. 17,
p. 233); of <span class='sc'>Monteverde</span> (Vol. 18, p. 778),
the pioneer of the monodist revolt at
the end of the 16th century, of <span class='sc'>Scarlatti,
Alessandro</span> (Vol. 24, p. 302), 17th century,
who perfected the aria form, of
<span class='sc'>Purcell, Henry</span> (Vol. 22, p. 658), the
great English composer of the 17th
century, of <span class='sc'>Johann Sebastian Bach</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 126) 18th century, of <span class='sc'>Schubert</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 380), the creator of the
modern song, of <span class='sc'>Schumann</span> (Vol. 24,
p. 384) who brought a yet greater intimacy
into the form, of <span class='sc'>Hugo Wolf</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 771), the most clairvoyant
of song writers, of <span class='sc'>Sir Hubert Parry</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 865), and <span class='sc'>Sir Charles
Villiers Stanford</span> (Vol. 25, p. 773),
who have respectively done the best
modern work in the English and Irish
tradition, and of the American <span class='sc'>MacDowell</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 214). Reference
should also be made to the articles
<span class='sc'>Melody</span> (Vol. 18, p. 96), <span class='sc'>Accompaniment</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 122), <span class='sc'>Rhythm</span> (Vol. 23,
p. 277). Suggestive also are the articles
<span class='sc'>Ballads</span> (Vol. 3, p. 264), <span class='sc'>Poetry</span> (Vol.
21, p. 889). On the technique of singing
the article <span class='sc'>Voice</span> (Vol. 28, p. 172) by
Dr. J. G. McKendrick, will be found
very helpful, especially the section on
the <i>Physiology of Voice Production</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>(4) MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</h4>

<p class='c017'>One branch of the subject yet remains,
that of musical instruments. Here the
editor of the Britannica had the advantage
of the assistance of Miss Kathleen
Schlesinger (author of <i>The Instruments
of the Orchestra</i>, and the greatest authority
on the subject), who contributed
practically all of the articles in the book
on musical instruments. A list of them
is given below, classified under their
most convenient groupings. From these
articles in the Encyclopaedia Britannica
the reader will get a full account of
every known musical instrument whether
modern or ancient, with its compass, and
scale, and of its connection with other
instruments of the same class; so that
the evolution of every type is clearly
brought out. As a preliminary to a
general study of the subject, the articles
<span class='sc'>Orchestra</span> (Vol. 20, p. 168), and <span class='sc'>Instrumentation</span>
(Vol. 14, p. 651) may
conveniently be read. In the former
Miss Schlesinger gives a summary of
the development of the various classes
of instruments and of their concerted
use. In the article <span class='sc'>Instrumentation</span>,
on the other hand, Donald Tovey illustrates
the <i>principles</i> which govern their
use. This article closes with an interesting
survey of the orchestral schemes
at different periods in the history of the
art. The following classified list of
separate articles on musical instruments
in the Britannica, shows how very completely
this work covers the field:</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXII<br> <span class='c014'>THE FINE ARTS: GENERAL AND INTRODUCTORY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The art-student and every other
reader interested in the fine arts
will find in the Britannica the
material for courses of reading of very
great range and of the utmost interest
and value—whether he wishes to study
theory, practice or history.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theory of Art</div>

<p class='c007'>Of course no adequate treatment of
the arts, or of any one of them, could
logically, much less advantageously, separate
theory, practice and
history. But the theory
of art, though it may be
inferred or deduced from
many other articles in the book, including
those the most devoted to the practical
or historical, may best and most directly
be studied in three articles, <span class='sc'>Aesthetics</span>,
<span class='sc'>Art</span>, and <span class='sc'>Fine Arts</span>. Of these, the first,
<span class='sc'>Aesthetics</span> (Vol. 1, p. 277), equivalent
to nearly 40 pages of this Guide, is written
by Professor James Sully, late of
University College, London, and author
of <i>The Human Mind</i> and other psychological
studies. It discusses the meaning
of beauty and the problem of the nature
of pleasure, especially “higher” pleasure,
its relation to play, etc. And the article
closes with a history of Aesthetic Theories,
including those of the following
philosophers, on all of whom the student
will find separate and elaborate critical
biographies in the Britannica: <span class='sc'>Plato</span>,
who set beauty high, but thought art
a mere trick of imitation and wished it
be censored rather than encouraged in
his model republic; <span class='sc'>Aristotle</span>, who sets
beauty above the useful and necessary,
but whose aesthetic seems to be applied
to poetry rather than to any other art;
the German philosophers, <span class='sc'>Kant</span>, <span class='sc'>Schelling</span>,
<span class='sc'>Hegel</span>, <span class='sc'>Schopenhauer</span>, who so
deeply impressed their theories on the
literature of their times, etc. The articles
<span class='sc'>Art</span> (Vol. 2, p. 657) and <span class='sc'>Fine Arts</span>
are both by Sir Sidney Colvin, formerly
keeper of prints and drawings, British
Museum. The former begins with a
contrast between art and nature—the
contrast made famous by Pope, by
Chaucer, repeatedly by Shakespeare and
by Dr. Johnson in his definition of Art
as “the power of doing something which
is not taught by Nature or by instinct.”
This definition is in itself an excellent
text for a discourse on the importance
in the study of the fine arts of the best
literature on the subject. But Sir Sidney
Colvin points out that the definition
is incomplete, since Art</p>

<p class='c020'>is a name not only for the power of doing
something, but for the exercise of the power;
and not only for the exercise of the
power, but for the rules according to which
it is exercised; and not only for the rules,
but for the result. Painting, for instance,
is an art, and the word connotes not only
the power to paint, but the act of painting;
and not only the act, but the laws for
performing the act rightly; and not only
all these, but the material consequences of
the act or the thing painted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Art is then “<i>Every regulated</i> operation
or dexterity by which organized beings
pursue ends which they know beforehand,
together with the rules and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>result of every such operation or dexterity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And a consideration of the etymology
of the words “Art” and “Kunst” is the
basis of a discussion of the relation of
Science and Art, which is summed up in
these words:</p>

<p class='c020'>Science consists in knowing, Art consists
in doing. What I must do in order to
know, is Art subservient to Science: what
I must know in order to do, is Science subservient
to Art.</p>

<p class='c007'>After speaking of dancing, music, drawing,
painting, sculpture, architecture,
poetry, the author says:</p>

<p class='c020'>Of all these arts, the end is not use, but
pleasure, or pleasure before use, or at least
pleasure and use conjointly. In modern
language, there has grown up a usage
which has put them into a class by themselves
under the name of the Fine Arts, as
distinguished from the Useful or Mechanical
Arts. (See <span class='sc'>Aesthetics</span> and <span class='sc'>Fine
Arts</span>.) Nay, more, to them alone is often
appropriated the use of the generic word
Art.... And further yet, custom has
reduced the number which the class-word is
meant to include. When Art and the works
of Art are now currently spoken of in this
sense, not even music or poetry is frequently
denoted, but only architecture,
sculpture and painting by themselves, or
with their subordinate and decorative
branches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fine Arts</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Fine Arts</span> (Vol. 10, p. 355;
equivalent to 70 pages of this Guide)
is divided into the following parts:
<i>General Definition</i>, with
particular attention to
the theory that makes the
arts a form of play and to the definitions
of Plato and Schiller; <i>Classification</i>—architecture,
sculpture, painting, music
and poetry classified as “shaping” and
“speaking” or as imitative and “non-imitative,”
with definitions from the
aesthetic or philosophic point of view of
sculpture and of painting; and <i>Historical
Development</i>, with a criticism of Spencer’s
theory of the evolution and gradual
separation of the arts and of Taine’s
natural history, as well as a critical and
illuminating outline history of the arts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether we include under the fine
arts music and poetry, or with the more
popular usage make the fine arts not five
but three, architecture, painting and
sculpture, the arts may be studied in the
Britannica and there is the basis for this
study in this Guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Music is the subject of a separate
chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poetry is treated in the chapters on
Literature, but it will be well to remind
the student of the philosophy of art of
the remarkable article <span class='sc'>Poetry</span> (Vol. 21,
p. 877; equivalent to 45 pages in this
Guide) by Theodore Watts-Dunton,
and of the articles on the different poetic
forms, mostly by Edmund Gosse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Architecture in the Britannica is outlined
in this Guide in the chapter <i>For
Architects</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two chapters immediately following
this are devoted respectively to
Painting, Engraving and Drawing and
to Sculpture and the Subsidiary Arts.
Of practical value to the art student
as an introduction to these two chapters
are the articles <span class='sc'>Art Societies</span>, by A. C.
Robinson Carter, editor of <i>The Year’s
Art</i>, and <span class='sc'>Art Teaching</span>, by Walter
Crane, the English illustrator, who also
contributed the article <span class='sc'>Arts and Crafts</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>For an alphabetical list of articles on

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The article <span class='sc'>Painting</span> (Vol. 20, p.
459; equivalent to 190 pages of
this Guide) is an elaborate “key”
article which may well be the starting
point for more definite study. The art
student who actually wishes to paint or
draw—as distinct from the student of
the history of art—will do well to read
first in this great article its third section,
<i>The Technique of Painting</i> (pp. 482–497),
by Gerard Baldwin Brown, professor of
fine art, Edinburgh, and author of <i>The
Fine Arts</i>. The main topics in this part of
the article are:</p>

<p class='c020'>The Materials of Painting; The Surfaces
Covered by the Painter; Binding
Materials or Media; The Processes of
Painting, and their Historical Uses;
Painting with Coloured Vitreous Pastes
(with bibliography)—on this method
and on similar processes see the separate
articles <span class='sc'>Ceramics</span>, with remarkably
valuable and beautiful coloured illustrations;
<span class='sc'>Mosaic</span>; <span class='sc'>Enamel</span>; <span class='sc'>Glass,
Stained</span>. The following sections are
Fresco Painting (with bibliography)—see
Fig. 34, Plate X (facing p. 477);
Fresco-Secco (with bibliography);
Stereochromy or Water-Glass Painting
(with bibliography); Spirit Fresco
or the “Gambier Parry” Process, as
improved by Professor Church (with
bibliography); Oil Processes of Wall
Painting; Tempera Painting on Walls;
Encaustic Painting on Walls (with bibliography);
Encaustic Painting in General
(with bibliography); Tempera
Painting (with bibliography); Water
Colour Painting (with bibliography).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Drawing and Engraving</div>

<p class='c007'>In connection with this part of the article—theoretically
before it, perhaps,—the
student should
read the articles
<span class='sc'>Drawing</span> and <span class='sc'>Engraving</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Drawing</span> (Vol. 8, p. 552), by John R.
Fothergill, editor of <i>The Slade</i>, is a peculiarly
interesting article in its denial of
the possibility of conveying colour by
drawing or monochrome, in its tracing the
development of drawing from the “papery”
and flat first attempts on early
Greek vases to the depth, length and
breadth of the later Greeks or of a
Michelangelo, for its criticism of the
definition of artistic drawing as a process
of selection and elimination from the
forms of nature, and for its discussion of
style or personality in drawing. See also
the articles <span class='sc'>Caricature</span>, <span class='sc'>Cartoon</span>, <span class='sc'>Illustration</span>,
<span class='sc'>Poster</span>, <span class='sc'>Plumbago Drawings</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Engraving</span> (Vol. 9, p. 645) is a short
outline article to be supplemented by:
<span class='sc'>Line-Engraving</span> (Vol. 16, p. 721), by
Philip Gilbert Hamerton, author of
<i>Drawing and Engraving</i>, and more popularly
known as the author of <i>The Intellectual
Life</i>, <i>Human Intercourse</i> and other
essays, and by M. H. Spielmann, formerly
editor of the <i>Magazine of Art</i>; <span class='sc'>Wood
Engraving</span>, by the same authors; <span class='sc'>Mezzotint</span>,
by Gerald Philip Robinson, president
of the Society of Mezzotint Engravers;

<div class='sidenote'>History of Painting</div>

<p class='c007'>Although the articles enumerated in
the last paragraph have primarily to do
with technique, there is in them—especially
in such articles
as <span class='sc'>Miniature</span>
and <span class='sc'>Portraiture</span>—much
historical and
critical information. And from them the
student may well turn back to the article
<span class='sc'>Painting</span> to pursue there those topics
which he has not yet covered. These are:
<i>Part I.—A Sketch of the Development of
the Art</i> (pp. 460–478); <i>Part II.—Schools
of Painting</i>, a tabular scheme (pp. 479–481),
and <i>Recent Schools of Painting</i> (pp.
497–518), by M. H. Spielmann, for
British; Léonce Bénédite, keeper of
the Luxembourg Museum, for French;
Fernand Khnopff, painter and etcher, for
Belgian; Prof. J. C. Van Dyck, Rutgers
College, author of <i>History of American
Art</i>, for the United States; and Prof.
Richard Muther, Breslau University,
author of <i>The History of Modern Painting</i>,
on Dutch, German, Austrian, Italian,
Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian,
Russian and Balkan States.</p>

<p class='c007'>These parts of the article are illustrated
with ten plates containing 36 figures, including
four prehistoric incised drawings
of animals found in French caves and
remarkable for their technical accuracy
and life; two paintings, a boar and a bison,
reproduced in colours, from the
palaeolithic cave of Altamira—see also
Plates II and III in the article <span class='sc'>Archaeology</span>
(between pp. 348 and 349, Vol. 2),
Figs. 6, 7 and 8 in Plate accompanying
<span class='sc'>Anthropology</span> (opposite p. 118, Vol. 2),
and the plates of American antiques in
the article <span class='sc'>America</span> (Vol. 1, pp. 808–816);
an excellent Egyptian drawing of
birds; the François vase (Greek); a Pompeian
wall painting—see also the reproduction
in colours of a wall-painting from
a Roman villa in the article <span class='sc'>Mural
Decoration</span> (Vol. 20, p. 22); a wall
painting from Brunswick cathedral; and
typical examples of the work of Hubert
van Eyck, Giotto, Lorenzetti, Masaccio,
Uccello, Pollaiuolo, Piero della Francesca,
Ghirlandajo, Mantegna, Bellini, Giorgione,
Michelangelo, Botticelli, Titian,
Holbein, Watteau, Gainsborough, Rembrandt,
Quintin Matsys, Brouwer, Ruysdael,
Turner, Chardin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A rough division of the whole history
of art into four main periods” gives
“first&#160;... the efforts of the older
Oriental peoples, best represented by the
painting of the Egyptians; the second includes
the classical and medieval epochs
up to the beginning of the 15th century;
the third the 15th and 16th centuries, and
the fourth the time from the beginning of
the 17th century onward. In the first
period the endeavour is after truth of
contour, in the second and third after
truth of form, in the fourth after truth of
space.”</p>

<p class='c020'>The Egyptian artist was satisfied if he
could render with accuracy, and with proper
emphasis on what is characteristic, the
silhouettes of things in nature regarded as
little more than flat objects cut out against
a light background. The Greek and the
medieval artist realized that objects had
three dimensions, and that it was possible
on a flat surface to give an indication of
the thickness of anything, that is, of its
depth away from the spectator, as well as
its length and breadth, but they cannot be
said to have fully succeeded in the difficult
task they set themselves. For this there
was needful an efficient knowledge of perspective,
and this the 15th century brought
with it. During the 15th century the
painter fully succeeds in mastering the
representation of the third dimension, and
during the next he exercises the power thus
acquired in perfect freedom, producing
some of the most convincing and masterly
presentments of solid forms upon a flat
surface that the art has to show. During
this period, however, and to a more partial
extent even in the earlier classical epoch,
efforts were being made to widen the horizon
of the art and to embrace within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>scope of its representations not only solid
objects in themselves, but such objects as
a whole in space, in due relation to each
other and to the universe at large. It was
reserved, however, for the masters of the
17th century perfectly to realize this ideal
of the art, and in their hands painting as
an art of representation is widened out to
its fullest possible limits, and the whole of
nature in all its aspects becomes for the
first time the subject of the picture.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Early Painting</div>

<p class='c007'>Following this classification, the article
<span class='sc'>Painting</span>, after commenting on primitive
art among bushmen, Eskimo and Australians
and on the remarkable
cave drawings
and paintings of
Altamira, Gourdan and Lortet,—even the
paintings are thought to be 50,000 years
old,—discusses the painting of contour in
Egypt and Babylonia, in prehistoric
Greece, in ancient Greece and Italy, and in
the early Christian and early medieval periods.
Of particular interest is the criticism
of Greek drawing.</p>

<p class='c020'>It may be admitted that in many artistic
qualities it was beyond praise. In beauty,
in grace of line, in composition, we can
imagine works of Apelles, of Zeuxis, of
Protogenes, excelling even the efforts of
the Italian painters, or only matched by
the finest designs of a Raphael or a Leonardo....
The facts, however, remain,
first, that the Greek pictures about
which we chiefly read were of single figures,
or subjects of a very limited and
compact order, with little variety of planes;
and second, that the existing remains of
ancient painting are so full of mistakes in
perspective that the representation of distance
cannot have been a matter to which
the artists had really set themselves....
The problem of representing correctly the
third dimension of space&#160;... had certainly
not been solved.... It is an additional
confirmation of this view to find
early Christian and early medieval painting
confined to the representation of the few
near objects which the older Oriental artists
had all along envisaged.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have now come to modern times so
far as painting is concerned. The article
<span class='sc'>Painting</span> says:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fourth Period: 17th Century and After</div>

<p class='c020'>By the 17th century the development of
painting had passed through all its stages,
and the picture was
no longer a mere silhouette
or a transcript
of objects
against a flat background,
but rather an
enchanted mirror of the world, in which
might be reflected space beyond space in infinite
recession. With this transformation
of the picture there was connected a complete
change in the relation of the artist to
nature. Throughout all the earlier epochs of
the art the painter had concerned himself
not with nature as a whole, but with certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>selected aspects of nature that furnished
him with his recognized subjects. These
subjects were selected on account of their
intrinsic beauty or importance, and as representing
intrinsic worth they claimed to be
delineated in the clearest and most substantial
fashion. In the 17th century, not only
was the world as a whole brought within
the artist’s view, but it presented itself as
worthy in every part of his most reverent
attention. In other words, the art of the
17th century, and of the modern epoch in
general, is democratic, and refuses to acknowledge
that difference in artistic value
among the aspects of nature which was at
the basis of the essentially aristocratic art
of the Greeks and Italians.... The
artist who was the first to demonstrate convincingly
this principle of modern painting
was Rembrandt.... Rembrandt in
his later work attended to the pictorial effect
alone, and practically annulled the objects
by reducing them to pure tone and
color. Things are not there at all, but only
the semblance or effect, or “impression” of
things. Breadth is in this way combined
with the most delicate variety, and a new
form of painting, now called “impressionism,”
has come into being.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the article on <span class='sc'>Painting</span> this summary
follows the outline of the general development
of painting through the 17th century:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Kinds of Painting</div>

<p class='c020'>The fact that the Dutch painters have
left us masterpieces in so many different
walks of painting,
makes it convenient
that we should add
here some brief notes
on characteristic modern phases of the
art on which they stamped the impress of
their genius. The normal subject for the
artist, as we have seen, up to the 17th
century, was the figure-subject, generally
in some connexion with religion. The Egyptian
portrayed the men and women of his
time, but the pictures, through their connexion
with the sepulchre, had a quasi-religious
significance.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Portraiture</i> is differentiated from this
kind of subject-picture through stages
which it would be interesting to trace, but
the portrait, though secular, is always
treated in such a way as to exalt or dignify
the sitter. Another kind of figure-piece,
also differentiated by degrees from the
subject-picture of the loftier kind, is the
so-called <i>Genre Painting</i>, in which the human
actors and their goings-on are in
themselves indifferent, trivial, or mean, and
even repellent; and in which, accordingly,
intrinsic interest of subject has disappeared
to be replaced by an artistic interest
of a different kind. <i>Landscape</i>, in
modern times so important a branch of
painting, is also an outcome of the traditional
figure-piece, for at first it is nothing
but a background to a scene in which
human figures are prominent. <i>Marine
Painting</i> is a branch of landscape art differentiated
from this, but supplied at first
in the same way with figure-interest. The
origin of <i>Animal Painting</i> is to be sought
partly in figure-pieces, where, as in Egypt
and Assyria, animals play a part in scenes
of human life, and partly in landscapes, in
which cattle, &#38;c., are introduced to enliven
the foreground. The <i>Hunting Picture</i>, combining
a treatment of figures and animals
in action with landscape of a picturesque
character, gives an artist like Rubens a
welcome opportunity, and the picture of
<i>Dead Game</i> may be regarded as its offshoot.
This brings us to the important
class of <i>Still-life Painting</i>, the relation of
which to the figure-piece can be traced
through the genre picture and the portrait.</p>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>The article then proceeds to sketch the
history and development of different
kinds of painting:</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Portraiture</i>:</p>

<p class='c020'>It is Gentile and Giovanni Bellini&#160;...
who may be regarded as the fathers of
modern portrait painting. Venetian art
was always more secular in spirit than that
of the rest of Italy, and Venetian portraits
were abundant.... Some of the finest
portraits in the world are the work of the
great Venetians of the 16th century, for
they combine pictorial quality with an air
of easy greatness which later painters find
it hard to impart to their creations.
Though greatly damaged, Titian’s equestrian
portrait of Charles V. at Madrid
(fig. 26, Plate VIII.) is one of the very
finest of existing works of the kind. It is
somewhat remarkable that of the other
Italian painters who executed portraits the
most successful was the idealist Raphael,
whose papal portraits of Julius II. and Leo
X. are masterpieces of firm and accurate
delineation. Leonardo’s “Monna Lisa” is
a study rather than a portrait proper.</p>

<p class='c020'>The realistic vein, which, as we have
seen, runs through northern painting, explains
to some extent the extraordinary
merit in portraiture of Holbein, who represents
the culmination of the efforts in
this direction of masters like Jan van
Eyck and Dürer.... Frans Hals of
Haarlem, one of the most brilliant painters
of the impressionist school that he did
much to found, achieved remarkable success
in the artistic grouping of a number
of portraits.... As portraitists the
other great 17th-century masters fall into
two sets, Rembrandt and Velazquez contrasting
with Rubens and his pupil Van
Dyck.... In the 18th century, though
France produced some good limners and
Spain Goya, yet on the whole England was
the home of the best portraiture. Van
Dyck had been in the service of Charles I.,
and foreign representatives of his style
carried on afterwards the tradition of his
essentially courtly art, but there existed at
the same time a line of native British portraitists
of whom the latest and best was
Hogarth. One special form of portraiture,
the <i>miniature</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), has been characteristically
English throughout....</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Genre</i>:</p>

<p class='c020'>Probably the most excellent painters of
genre are Ter Borch, Metsu and Brouwer,
the two first painters of the life of the upper
classes, the last of peasant existence in
some of its most unlovely aspects. The
pictures of Brouwer are among the most
instructive documents of modern painting....
He is best represented in the
Munich Pinacotek, from which has been
selected fig. 30, Plate IX. Hardly less admirable
are Teniers in Flanders; De
Hooch, Ver Meer of Delft, Jan Steen, A.
van Ostade, in Holland, while in more modern
times Hogarth, Chardin, Sir David
Wilkie, Meissonier, and a host of others
carry the tradition of the work down to
our own day (see Table VIII.)....</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Landscape and Marine Painting</i>:</p>

<p class='c020'>Several of the Dutch masters, even before
the time of Rembrandt, excelled in the
truthful rendering of the scenes and objects
of their own simple but eminently
paintable country; but it was Rembrandt,
with his pupil, de Koningk, and his rival in
this department Jacob Ruysdael, who
were the first to show how a perfectly natural
and unconventional rendering of a
stretch of country under a broad expanse
of sky might be raised by poetry and ideal
feeling to the rank of one of the world’s
masterpieces of painting. Great as was
Rembrandt in what Bode has called “the
landscape of feeling,” the “Haarlem from
the Dunes” of Ruysdael (fig. 31, Plate
IX.) with some others of this artist’s acknowledged
successes, surpass even his
achievement.... Among Turner’s chief
titles to honour is the fact that he portrayed
the sea in all its moods with a
knowledge and sympathy that give him a
place alone among painters of marine....</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Animal Painting</i>:</p>

<p class='c020'>In Holland, in the 17th century, the animal
nature presented itself under the more
contemplative aspect of the ruminants in
the lush water-meadows. True to their
principle of doing everything they attempt
in the best possible way, the Dutch paint
horses (Cuyp, Wouwerman) and cattle
(Cuyp, Adrian Vandevelde, Paul Potter)
with canonical perfection, while Hondekoeter
delineates live cocks and hens, and
Weenix dead hares and moor-fowl, in a
way that makes us feel that the last word
on such themes has been spoken. There is
a large white turkey by Hondekoeter in
which the truth of mass and of texture in
the full soft plumage is combined with a
delicacy in the detail of the airy filaments,
that is the despair of the most accomplished
modern executant.</p>

<p class='c020'>But animals have been treated more
nobly than when shown in Flemish agitation
or in Dutch phlegmatic calm. Leonardo
da Vinci was specially famed for
his horses, which he may have treated with
something of the majesty of Pheidias....</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Still-Life Painting</i>:</p>

<p class='c020'>There is no finer Rembrandt for pictorial
quality than the picture in the Louvre
representing the carcase of a flayed ox in
a flesher’s booth. As illustrating the principle
of modern painting this form of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>graphic art has a value and importance
which in itself it could hardly claim....
The way was prepared for it as has been
noticed, by the minute and forcible rendering
of accessory objects in the figure-pieces
and portraits of the early Flemish masters,
of Dürer, and above all of Holbein. The
painting of flower and fruit pieces without
figure interest by Jan Breughel the
younger, who was born in 1601, represents
a stage onward, and contemporary with
him were several other Dutch and Flemish
specialists in this department, among whom
Jan David de Heem, born 1603, and the
rather older Willem Klaasz Heda may be
mentioned. Their subjects sometimes took
the form of a luncheon table with vessels,
plate, fruit and other eatables; at other
times of groups of costly vessels of gold, silver
and glass, or of articles used in art or
science, such as musical instruments and
the like; and it is especially to be noted
that the handling stops always short of
any illusive reproduction of the actual textures
of the objects, while at the same time
the differing surfaces of stuffs and metal
and glass, of smooth-rinded apples and
gnarled lemons, are all most justly rendered....
In this form of painting
the French 18th-century artist Chardin,
whose impasto was fuller, whose colouring
more juicy than those of the Dutch, has
achieved imperishable fame (see fig. 33,
Plate X.); and the modern French, who
understand better than others the technical
business of painting, have carried on the
fine tradition which has culminated in the
work of Vollon. The Germans have also
painted still-life to good result, but the
comparative weakness in technique of British
painters has kept them in this department
rather in the background.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>National Schools of Painting</div>

<p class='c007'>The history of painting since the 17th
century may best be studied in the Britannica
in the order in which “recent
schools” are treated
(Vol. 20, pp. 497–518),
and this plan
will be followed here
in a brief outline, giving only a few out
of many articles for each country.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>British</div>

<p class='c007'>British art in the 17th and 18th centuries
is dependent largely on foreign and
particularly Flemish influences—Van
Dyck in especial. See Rossetti’s
articles on <span class='sc'>Lely</span> and
<span class='sc'>Kneller</span>, who, like Holbein
and Van Dyck, were importations,
but, unlike them, were pretty thoroughly
Anglicized. For the first purely English
painter see Austin Dobson’s article <span class='sc'>Hogarth</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 566). For “the most
prominent figure in the English school of
painting” whose <i>Discourses</i> largely affected
English notions of aesthetics, see
<span class='sc'>Sir Joshua Reynolds</span>; also the article on
his rival <span class='sc'>George Romney</span>. And read
Rossetti’s article <span class='sc'>Gainsborough</span>; and
those on the portrait painters <span class='sc'>Raeburn</span>
and <span class='sc'>Sir Thomas Lawrence</span>. On the Norwich
school of landscapists see the articles
<span class='sc'>Crome</span>, <span class='sc'>Cotman</span> and <span class='sc'>George Vincent</span>.
For foreign influences on landscape painting
see <span class='sc'>Richard Wilson</span> (Vol. 28, p. 695)
for French influence, and <span class='sc'>John Constable</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 982), by C. J. Holmes,
author of <i>Constable and His Influence on
Landscape Painting</i>, for German. With
the article on the greatest of English
landscapists <span class='sc'>J. M. W. Turner</span> (Vol. 27,
p. 474), by Sir George Reid, the student
should read Frederic Harrison’s article on
<span class='sc'>John Ruskin</span>, himself an exquisite
draughtsman, although unable to compose
a picture, whose championship of
Turner and general theories of art so
strongly influenced British painting. See
also the articles on the subject painter
<span class='sc'>Thomas Stothard</span> and the landscapist
<span class='sc'>Girtin</span>; and on the genre painters, <span class='sc'>Sir
David Wilkie</span>, by J. Miller Gray, late
curator of the Scottish National Portrait
Gallery, <span class='sc'>Mulready</span>, <span class='sc'>William Collins</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Frith</span>. See the article <span class='sc'>William
Blake</span>, by J. W. Comyns-Carr, author of
<i>Essays on Art</i>, for an appreciation of that
remarkable genius, who in his combination
of painting and poetry may be reckoned
a forerunner of the Pre-Raphaelites.
On the P. R. Brotherhood see the articles:

the Empire and of Prussia is the theme of
the new historical school: see particularly
<span class='sc'>Menzel</span>. The study of the old masters
is to be seen in <span class='sc'>Kaulbach</span> and <span class='sc'>Lenbach</span>.

<div class='sidenote'>17th and 18th Century</div>

<p class='c007'>Some of the names just mentioned
are those of 17th century artists. But
the rococo character
of the period is
best seen in Italy:
see the articles <span class='sc'>Bernini</span>,
<span class='sc'>Algardi</span>, and, for France, <span class='sc'>Girardon</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>and <span class='sc'>Puget</span>. With the 18th century
came a classical revival for which the
great names are <span class='sc'>Canova</span> and <span class='sc'>Thorwaldsen</span>:
see the articles on these sculptors,
that on Canova being by W. M.
Rossetti. See also the articles on Thorwaldsen’s
followers, <span class='sc'>Sergel</span>, <span class='sc'>Byström</span>
and <span class='sc'>Fogelberg</span>. The more important
articles on French sculpture in this period
are <span class='sc'>Pigalle</span> and <span class='sc'>Houdon</span>, the latter
known to Americans by his portraits of
our Revolutionary worthies. For English
sculpture in the 17th and 18th centuries
see: <span class='sc'>Nicholas Stone</span>, <span class='sc'>Roubiliac</span>,
by M. H. Spielmann, <span class='sc'>Scheemakers</span>,
<span class='sc'>Nollekens</span>, <span class='sc'>John Bacon</span>, and, possibly
most important, <span class='sc'>John Flaxman</span>, by Sir
Sidney Colvin. For Germany: <span class='sc'>Andreas
Schlüter</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>19th Century and Modern Schools</div>

<p class='c007'>On the 19th century in Germany see
the articles: <span class='sc'>Schadow</span>, <span class='sc'>Rauch</span>, <span class='sc'>Rietschel</span>,
<span class='sc'>Dannecker</span>, <span class='sc'>Schwanthaler</span>, and
marking a sharp reaction,
<span class='sc'>Reinhold
Begas</span>, and the
younger men, known
also as painters,
<span class='sc'>Franz Stuck</span> and <span class='sc'>Max Klinger</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>On modern British sculpture see the
articles: <span class='sc'>John Gibson</span>, <span class='sc'>E. H. Baily</span>,
<span class='sc'>Thomas Banks</span>, <span class='sc'>Sir Richard Westmacott</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Alfred Stevens</span>; and, for
the last thirty years, <span class='sc'>Jules Dalou</span>,
<span class='sc'>Lord Leighton</span>, better known as a
painter, <span class='sc'>E. Onslow Ford</span> and <span class='sc'>Alfred
Gilbert</span>, the most influential and important
factors in the awakening, and

work summarized on pp. 501–508 in the
article <span class='sc'>Sculpture</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>France</div>

<p class='c007'>The 19th century in France opened with
a pseudo-Roman school,
and among the names of this
period are <span class='sc'>Pradier</span>, <span class='sc'>Rude</span>,
<span class='sc'>P. J. David</span>, <span class='sc'>Etex</span>, and <span class='sc'>Carpeaux</span> and
<span class='sc'>Barye</span>, by Henri Frantz, who mark
a transition. For the more modern
period see <span class='sc'>Guillaume</span>, <span class='sc'>Dubois</span>, <span class='sc'>Falguière</span>,
<span class='sc'>Mercié</span>, <span class='sc'>Frémiet</span>, <span class='sc'>Gustave

<div class='sidenote'>Other European Countries</div>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the discussion of modern
Belgian sculptors in the section

<div class='sidenote'>Summary</div>

<p class='c007'>This chapter, and the one before, outline
courses on these arts in the Britannica,
but there are many articles
on these topics to which no
reference has been made in
these pages. It may, therefore, be interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>to the student of these forms of
art to have before him a list, fairly complete,
of articles in the Britannica dealing
with painting and sculpture. The following
is such a list in alphabetical
arrangement. The student should remember
that the absence from the list—or
from any similar list in the Guide—of
a topic on which he wishes information
does not mean that there is no information
on the subject in the Britannica,
but merely that there may be no separate
article on the subject. In such cases let
him turn to the general index (Vol. 29).</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Evolution</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>One of the most interesting subjects
of scientific study developed
during the last century is that of
primitive culture and the gradual advancement
of primitive man from a
state of savagery to comparative civilization.
For this study there are no historical
documents in the ordinary use of the
words “historical” and “document.” The
story must be arrived at by analysis, deduction,
even by guess-work, supplementing
the studies of travelers among
tribes which now are in the lowest stages
of development and farthest from civilization,
and therefore most resemble our
remotest human ancestors. Almost the
very earliest of writers on
evolution, the Roman poet
<span class='sc'>Lucretius</span> (Vol. 17, p. 107),
who died in 55 B.C., sketched general outlines
of the development of this primitive
civilization in much the same way as
do modern ethnologists. But his description
was imaginary and was fashioned
to fit his and Epicurus’s evolutionary
theories.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Civilization</span> (Vol. 6, p.
403) in the Britannica makes the development
of speech the mark of the first
period when mankind was in the lower
stages of savagery. “Our ancestors of
this epoch inhabited a necessarily restricted
tropical territory and subsisted
upon raw nuts and fruit.” The next
higher period in the progress of civilization
began with the knowledge of the use
of fire (p. 404).</p>

<p class='c020'>This wonderful discovery enabled the developing
race to extend its habitat almost
indefinitely, and to include flesh, and in
particular fish, in its regular dietary. Man
could now leave the forests and wander
along the shores and rivers, migrating to
climates less enervating than those to which
he had previously been confined. Doubtless
he became an expert fisher, but he was as
yet poorly equipped for hunting....
Primitive races of Australia and Polynesia
had not advanced beyond this middle status
of savagery when they were discovered a
few generations ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next great ethnical discovery was
that of the bow and arrow, a truly wonderful
instrument.</p>

<p class='c020'>The possessor of this device could bring
down the fleetest animal and could defend
himself against the most predatory. He
could provide himself not only with food,
but with materials for clothing and for
tent-making, and thus could migrate at will
back from the seas and large rivers....
The meat diet, now for the first time freely
available, probably contributed, along with
the stimulating climate, to increase the
physical vigour and courage of this highest
savage, thus urging him along the paths of
progress. Nevertheless, many tribes came
thus far, and no further, as witness the
Athapascans of the Hudson’s Bay Territory
and the Indians of the valley of the
Columbia.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the use of fire and the discovery of
the bow and arrow came the invention
of pottery, the domestication of animals,
and the smelting of iron, all successive
stages in man’s history which “in their
relation to the sum of human progress,
transcend in relative importance all his
subsequent works,”—and this is even
truer if there is included in this period the
development of a system of writing,
which may be reckoned either the end of
the primitive period or the beginning of
the period of <i>civilization proper</i>. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>two great steps in the story of civilization,
language and writing, are closely
connected in our minds, though so far
separated in time of origin; and their
story as told in the Britannica by the
world’s greatest authorities, English,
American, German, French, Italian, Danish,
etc., is an interesting one for the general
reader, while the articles are invaluable
to the specialist in linguistic
study.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Philology</div>

<p class='c007'>The starting point for a course of reading
is the article <span class='sc'>Philology</span> (Vol. 21, p.
414; equivalent to 80 pages in this Guide),
of which the first
part, a general treatment,
is by the
greatest of American philologists, William
Dwight Whitney, editor-in-chief of <i>The
Century Dictionary</i>, and author of <i>Life
and Growth of Language</i>, one of the
most important scientific contributions to
the subject. The second part, on the
comparative philology of the Indo-European
languages, is by Prof. Eduard
Sievers of Leipzig and Prof. Peter Giles
of Cambridge. Both these names are
well known to students of the subject,
the former as that of the author of numerous
valuable works on Germanic phonetics
and metric, and the latter as a
writer on Greek language and as the
author of <i>A Short Manual of Comparative
Philology</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article begins with a definition of
“philology,” the science of language, and
of “comparative philology,” the comparison
of one language with another, in
order to bring out their relationships,
their structures, and their histories.
Prof. Whitney shows how much the recent
development of linguistic science
owes to the general scientific movement
of the age. “No one,” he says, “however
ingenious and entertaining his speculations,
will cast any real light on the
earliest history of speech.” But he notes
the obvious analogy between speech and
writing, and he puts stress on the “sociality”
of man as the prime factor in his
development of speech. Other topics in
this part of the article are:</p>

<p class='c020'>Instrumentalities of expression—gesture,
grimace, and voice; “language”
means “tonguiness”—a mute
would call it “handiness”; advantages
of voice over gesture.</p>

<p class='c020'>Imitation as a factor in development
of language and of writing; onomatopoetic
origin of words.</p>

<p class='c020'>Development of sign-making:
“Among the animals of highest intelligence
that associate with man and learn
something of his ways, a certain amount
of sign-making expressly for communication
is not to be denied; the dog that
barks at a door because he knows that
somebody will come and let him in is an
instance of it; perhaps, in wild life, the
throwing out of sentinel birds from a
flock, whose warning cry shall advertise
their fellows of the threat of danger,
is as near an approach to it as is
anywhere made.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Brute speech and human speech:
“Those who put forward language as
the distinction between man and the
lower animals, and those who look
upon our language as the same in kind
with the means of communication of
the lower animals, only much more
complete and perfect, fail alike to comprehend
the true nature of language,
and are alike wrong in their arguments
and conclusions. No addition to or
multiplication of brute speech would
make anything like human speech; the
two are separated by a step which no
animal below man has ever taken; and,
on the other hand, language is only the
most conspicuous among those institutions
the development of which has
constituted human progress.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Language and culture: “Differences
of language, down to the possession
of language at all, are differences
only in respect to education and culture.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Development of language signs: the
beginning slow, acceleration cumulative.</p>

<p class='c020'>The root-stage: first signs must have
been “integral, significant in their entirety,
not divisible into parts.”</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Earliest phonetic forms: the simplest
syllabic combination a single consonant
with a following vowel. See
the article <span class='sc'>Hawaii</span> (Vol. 13, p. 88) for
a similar language even now in existence:
“Every syllable is open, ending
in a vowel sound, and short sentences
may be constructed wholly of vocalic
sounds.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Character of early speech: “first
language-signs must have denoted
those physical acts and qualities which
are directly apprehensible by the senses....
We are still all the time drawing
figurative comparisons between material
and moral things and processes,
and calling the latter by the names of
the former.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Development of language as illustrated
in Indo-European speech.</p>

<p class='c020'>Laws of growth and change: internal
growth by multiplication of meanings;
phonetic change—the principle
of economy (euphony); borrowing and
mixing of vocabularies.</p>

<p class='c020'>Classification of languages by structural
types: isolating (Chinese); agglutinative
(Turkish, etc.); inflective
(Indo-European); or—a more elaborate
classification:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Indo-European Languages</div>

<p class='c007'>Indo-European: on which see part II
of the article <span class='sc'>Philology</span> and the article
<span class='sc'>Indo-European Languages</span> (Vol. 14, p.
495; equivalent to
20 pages of this
Guide), by Prof.
Peter Giles,—especially
interesting for the attempt on a linguistic
basis to reconstruct the original
civilization and to discover the home of
the ancestors of this language-stock
which now occupies nearly all of Europe
and is so intimately connected with the
civilization of the last 2500 years. See:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Greek Language</span> (Vol. 12, p. 496), by
Professor Giles, and articles <span class='sc'>Homer</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 626); <span class='sc'>Dorians</span> (Vol. 8, p.
423), etc.; but the main treatment of
different Greek dialects is in the article
<span class='sc'>Greek Language</span> (Vol. 12, p. 496), to
which the student should refer for Arcadian
and Cyprian, Aeolic, Ionic-Attic,
and Doric dialects.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Latin Language</span> (Vol. 16, p. 244), by
Dr. A. S. Wilkins, late professor of Latin,
Owens College, Manchester, and Dr.
Robert S. Conway, professor of Latin,
University of Manchester, with a peculiarly
valuable summary of <i>The Language
as Recorded</i>, which is a linguistic
critique of the style and vocabulary of the
great Roman authors and a comparison
(p. 253) of Latin and Greek prose. And
see the articles on the dialects of ancient
Italy: <span class='sc'>Italy</span>, <i>Ancient Languages and
People</i>; <span class='sc'>Etruria</span>, <i>Language</i>; <span class='sc'>Liguria</span>,
<i>Philology</i>; <span class='sc'>Siculi</span>; <span class='sc'>Pompeii</span>, <i>Oscan Inscriptions</i>;

<span class='sc'>Samnites</span>, etc., by Prof. Conway,
which will serve the student as a foundation
for this subject, with more recent
revision of all that is known than there
is in Prof. Conway’s books, in the works
of C. D. Buck, or in other authorities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Alphabet</div>

<p class='c007'>This list of articles will serve the student
as a guide for the purely linguistic
articles. Besides the general treatment
in the article <span class='sc'>Philology</span> from which
we started, he should read articles on
such general subjects as <span class='sc'>Phonetics</span> (Vol.
21, p. 458), by Dr. Henry Sweet, author
of <i>A Primer of Phonetics</i>, <i>A History of
English Sounds since the Earliest Period</i>,
etc. This leads to a study of the article
<span class='sc'>Alphabet</span> (Vol. 1, p. 723), equivalent
to 30 pages of this Guide,
written by Professor Peter
Giles of Cambridge and
illustrated with a plate and various
fac-similes of early alphabets. This article
is supplemented by Professor Giles’s
articles on all the letters of the alphabet,
which deal with the history and form of
the symbol, the character of the sound
it stands for and, particularly, the development
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>and change of the sound in English
and its dialects. For instance the article
on the letter <i>N</i> describes four different
sounds, of which there are two in English—usually
distinguished as <i>n</i> and <i>ng</i>;
explains that in the early Indo-European
language some <i>n’s</i> and <i>m’s</i> could sometimes
be pronounced <i>as vowels</i>; describes
the opposite process, the nasalization of
vowels, especially in French; and closes
by saying: “It is possible to nasalize
some consonants as well as vowels;
nasalized spirants play an important
part in the so-called Yankee pronunciation
of Americans.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Artificial Languages</div>

<p class='c007'>From alphabets the student may well
turn to ideal languages in the article
<span class='sc'>Universal Languages</span> (Vol. 27, p. 746),
by Professor Henry
Sweet, which criticizes
Volapük and
Esperanto and the
Idiom Neutral as being unscientific, not
really international—even from a European
point of view, and still less when one
considers the growing importance of
Japan and China in world-trade and
world-history. Their being based on
national languages Dr. Sweet thinks is a
disadvantage. But in their comparative
success he sees proof that a universal
language is possible. See also Prof.
Sweet’s separate articles <span class='sc'>Volapük</span> (Vol.
28, p. 178) and <span class='sc'>Esperanto</span> (Vol. 9, p. 773).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Writing</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Writing</span> (Vol. 28, p. 852)
deals, chiefly from the anthropological
standpoint, with primitive attempts to
record ideas in an intelligible
form, for example with
“knot-signs,” “message-sticks,”
picture-writing and the like.
The needs, which led to the invention
of these primitive forms of writing,
were: mnemonic, recalling that something
is to be done at a certain time—the
primitive “tickler” was a knotted
string or thong, like our knotted handkerchief
as a reminder, and these knot-strings
were finally used for elementary
accountings, commercial or chronological,
like the use of the abacus in little shops,
or of the similar system in scoring games
of pool; to communicate with some one
at a distance, for which marked or
notched sticks, engraved or coloured
pebbles, wampum belts, etc., were used;
and, third, to distinguish one’s own
property or handicraft whence cattle-brands,
trade-marks, etc. In Assyria,
Egypt and China picture-writing developed
into conventional signs: on these
see <span class='sc'>Egypt</span> (Vol. 9, p. 60), and <span class='sc'>China</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 218). All of these are of
great interest to the general reader, but
the article <span class='sc'>Cuneiform</span> (Vol. 7, p. 629)
by Dr. R. W. Rogers, professor of Hebrew
and Old Testament exegesis, Drew Theological
Seminary, Madison, New Jersey,
has the sort of entertainment in it that
there is in a good detective story, since
it tells how the meaning of the mysterious
wedge-shaped inscriptions on the
rocks at Mount Rachmet in Persia was
discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject of writing is treated, also,
in the articles:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Inscriptions</span> (Vol. 14, p. 618); <i>Semitic</i>,

<i>Greek</i>, by Edward Lee Hicks, Bishop of
Lincoln, author of <i>Manual of Greek

Hübner, late professor of classical philology
at Berlin, author of <i>Romische

equivalent to 75 pages of this Guide,
by Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, late

author of <i>Handbook of Greek and Latin
Palaeography</i>, etc. The article is illustrated
with 50 fac-similes of typical
handwritings.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span><span class='sc'>Manuscript</span> (Vol. 17, p. 618), equivalent

MSS., and of writing implements and
inks. See, also, <span class='sc'>Illuminated Manuscripts</span>,
<span class='sc'>Papyrus</span>, <span class='sc'>Paper</span> and other
articles mentioned in the chapter in this
Guide <i>For Printers</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Text Criticism</div>

<p class='c007'>The student of language and literature
and of writing will also find much valuable
information in the article <span class='sc'>Textual
Criticism</span> (Vol. 26, p. 708),
equivalent to 25 pages of
this Guide, by Professor
J. P. Postgate of the University
of Liverpool, well-known to
Latinists as the brilliant editor of Tibullus
and Propertius. The article gives
examples of the classes of errors occurring
in texts and the methods of restoring
true readings—largely of course by conjecture—and
illustrates such errors and
their correction by the very poorly
printed first editions of the English
poet Shelley.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the study of language and writing
as in courses on other sciences and arts,
the reader will find an additional interest
in supplementing general and abstract
articles by biographical sketches of the
great men in the science.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVI<br> <span class='c014'>LITERATURE, INTRODUCTORY AND GENERAL</span></h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Contributors</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The student of literature, like the
student of painting, finds it as
necessary to examine the great
examples of the art as to study the laws
which guide the artist, for the history of
their development, and he will find that
the articles which discuss literature in
the Britannica are <i>themselves literature</i>,
models of the form of artistic expression
which they describe. A list of these contributors
who deal with literary topics
might, indeed, easily be mistaken for a
list of such articles on the great contemporary
writers as the student would most
desire to read. Among these contributors
are, for example: Edmund Gosse,
Theodore Watts-Dunton,
Swinburne,
A. C. Benson, John
Morley, Austin Dobson, Arthur Symons,
J. Addington Symonds, Frederic Harrison,
Walter Besant, William Sharp
(“Fiona Macleod”), Professor George
Saintsbury, Sir Arthur T. Quiller-Couch
(“Q”), William Archer, Israel Gollancz,
Robert Louis Stevenson, Andrew Lang,
Sir Leslie Stephen, E. V. Lucas, Arthur
Waugh, Mrs. Craigie (“John Oliver
Hobbes”), Alice Meynell, Mrs. Humphry
Ward, and—among American
names,—George E. Woodberry, Henry
Van Dyke, Edward Everett Hale, T. W.
Higginson, Brander Matthews, W. P.
Trent, Charles Eliot Norton, Charles
William Eliot, George W. Cable, Lyman
Abbott, Edmund Clarence Stedman,
John Burroughs, Thomas Davidson, Horace
E. Scudder, and Charles F. Richardson.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before discussing the articles in which
these and many other distinguished contributors
deal with various aspects of
literature, attention may be directed to
the treatment of religious literature in
the Britannica. The Bible is the subject
of a separate chapter in this Guide on
<i>Bible Study</i>, to which the reader is also
referred for the whole literature of Biblical
criticism. Religious literature based
upon the Bible is discussed in the articles
<span class='sc'>Liturgy</span> (Vol. 16, p. 795), by the Rev.
F. E. Warren; <span class='sc'>Sermon</span> (Vol. 24, p. 673),
by Edmund Gosse, and <span class='sc'>Hymns</span> (Vol. 14,
p. 181), by Lord Selborne, equivalent to
35 pages of this Guide. The medieval
miracle plays and mysteries, presenting
incidents from Scripture, are described
in the section on the <i>Medieval Drama</i>
(Vol. 8, p. 497) of the article <span class='sc'>Drama</span>. On
the literature of other religions, see the
chapter <i>For Ministers</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>The student of literature in general
may begin his course of reading with the
article <span class='sc'>Literature</span> (Vol. 16, p. 783), a
concise critical summary by
Dr. James Fitzmaurice-Kelly,
professor of Spanish
language and literature,
Liverpool University, best known as the
editor of Cervantes. Read, after the article
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span><span class='sc'>Literature</span>, the same contributor’s
article <span class='sc'>Translation</span> (Vol. 27, p. 183).
The student who does not wish to approach
literature from the philosophic
side need not read the articles <span class='sc'>Aesthetics</span>
and <span class='sc'>Fine Arts</span>; but even such a one
should read the article <span class='sc'>Style</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 1055), by Edmund Gosse, essayist,
poet, biographer and librarian of the
House of Lords, and the article <span class='sc'>Prose</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 450), by the same contributor.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a well-known and perfectly
authentic anecdote of Edmund Gosse’s
predecessor as librarian of the House of
Lords, who was once asked in the course
of a newspaper symposium on education,
“What were the principal factors in your
education?” He replied by putting second
only to his university training “the
articles in the Encyclopaedia Britannica
and in the <i>Athenaeum</i> by Theodore Watts-Dunton.”
Certainly the student will be
well repaid by repeated study and analysis
of Watts-Dunton’s article <span class='sc'>Poetry</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 877; equivalent to 45 pages of
this Guide). The same author’s articles
<span class='sc'>Sonnet</span> (Vol. 25, p. 414), <span class='sc'>Matthew Arnold</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 635), and <span class='sc'>Wycherley</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 863) should be studied with
the article <span class='sc'>Poetry</span> as supplementing his
literary philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greatest of literary forms is amply
represented by the space and the authority
given to it in the Britannica. The article
<span class='sc'>Drama</span> (Vol. 8, p. 475; equivalent to
225 pages of this Guide) is mainly the
work of Prof. A. W. Ward, master of
Peterhouse, Cambridge, editor of the
<i>Cambridge History of English Literature</i>
and of the <i>Cambridge Modern History</i>;
but some parts of the article are by William
Archer, the dramatic critic, and by
Auguste Filon (“Pierre Sandrié”). This
elaborate article should be supplemented
by the short article <span class='sc'>Comedy</span> (Vol. 6, p.
759) and by the biographical and critical
sketches of the great dramatists.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the many other articles in the
Britannica on the forms of literature are:
<span class='sc'>Satire</span> (Vol. 24, p. 228), by Richard
Garnett, late librarian British Museum,
with which the student may well combine
the articles <span class='sc'>Humour</span> and <span class='sc'>Irony</span>, the articles
<span class='sc'>Ballade</span>, <span class='sc'>Ballads</span> (Lang), <span class='sc'>Bucolics</span>,
<span class='sc'>Pastoral</span>, <span class='sc'>Cento</span>, <span class='sc'>Chant Royal</span>
(with Gosse’s first English chant royal,
“The Praise of Dionysus,” transcribed in
full), <span class='sc'>Descriptive Poetry</span>, <span class='sc'>Elegy</span>, <span class='sc'>Epic
Poetry</span>, <span class='sc'>Epithalamium</span>, <span class='sc'>Heroic Verse</span>,
<span class='sc'>Idyl</span>, <span class='sc'>Limerick</span>, <span class='sc'>Lyrical Poetry</span>, <span class='sc'>Macaronics</span>,
<span class='sc'>National Anthems</span>, <span class='sc'>Ode</span>, <span class='sc'>Ottava
Rima</span>, <span class='sc'>Pantun</span>, <span class='sc'>Rime Royal</span>, <span class='sc'>Rondeau</span>,
<span class='sc'>Rondel</span>, <span class='sc'>Sestett</span>, <span class='sc'>Sestina</span>, <span class='sc'>Song</span>,
<span class='sc'>Triolet</span>, <span class='sc'>Vers De Société</span>, <span class='sc'>Vilanelle</span>,
<span class='sc'>Virelay</span>, and—a few of the prose forms,
<span class='sc'>Biography</span>, <span class='sc'>Conte</span>, <span class='sc'>Criticism</span>, <span class='sc'>Epistle</span>,
<span class='sc'>Essay</span>, <span class='sc'>Euphuism</span>, <span class='sc'>Novel</span>, <span class='sc'>Pamphlet</span>,
<span class='sc'>Picaresque Novel</span>, <span class='sc'>Romance</span>, <span class='sc'>Tale</span>,
<span class='sc'>Tract</span>,—nearly all these being by Edmund
Gosse. Two articles of the utmost
importance are <span class='sc'>Dictionary</span> and <span class='sc'>Encyclopaedia</span>.

<span class='sc'>Rhetoric</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Periodical Publications</div>

<p class='c007'>Periodical publications, especially those
in the English and French languages, have
contained a great part of the best literary
criticism of miscellaneous
essays published
since the first
French review appeared
in 1665 and since the first English
review, consisting wholly of original matter,
was established in London in 1710.
The latter was indebted to France not
only for its model, but for its editor, who
was a French Protestant refugee. Benjamin
Franklin founded the first American
monthly, the Philadelphian <i>General
Magazine</i> in 1741. The article <span class='sc'>Periodicals</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 151), by H. R. Tedder,
librarian of the Athenaeum Club, London,
contains separate sections on the reviews
and magazines of <i>England</i>, the
<i>United States</i>, <i>Canada</i>, <i>South Africa</i>, <i>West
India and the British Crown Colonies</i>, <i>India
and Ceylon</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Germany</i>, <i>Austria</i>,
<i>Switzerland</i>, <i>Italy</i>, <i>Belgium</i>, <i>Holland</i>, <i>Denmark</i>,
<i>Norway</i>, <i>Sweden</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Portugal</i>,
<i>Greece</i>, <i>Russia</i>, <i>Bohemia</i>, <i>Hungary</i> and
<i>Japan</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span><span class='sc'>Newspapers</span> (Vol. 19, p. 544), equivalent
to 140 pages of this Guide, is an article
in which the student will find a full
account of the most fertile, if not the
most studied, form of modern literature
in all parts of the world. See also the
chapter in this Guide <i>For Journalists and
Authors</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader should note that of the
many articles on literary forms and rhetorical
figures, only a few are given above,
but they are listed more fully in the Index
Volume, p. 929, where there are more
than 350 such titles. He must remember
also that there are more than 3,000 biographical
and critical articles on authors
in different languages and different periods.

<div class='sidenote'>Bibliography</div>

<p class='c007'>This list of the literatures of many
tongues, from each of which translations
have added to the common stock accessible
even to those who can read with ease
only one language, indicates the existence
of a bewildering mass of printed matter,
and just as each language has its literature—using
the word to signify output,
so each subject upon which men write has
its literature—using the word to signify
material for any one branch of study.
Bibliographies are
the charts by which
students are enabled
to navigate these vast seas of knowledge.
The articles <span class='sc'>Bibliography</span> (Vol. 3, p.
908), by A. W. Pollard, assistant librarian
of the British Museum, and <span class='sc'>Index</span> (Vol.
14, p. 373) describe the technicalities of
cataloguing and classifying books and
their contents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Britannica is itself the most complete
index to the subjects treated by
books and the most complete bibliographical
manual for the student that
could be imagined. The Index of 500,000
entries (Vol. 29) shows to what class any
one of half a million facts belongs, by referring
to the article in which that fact is
treated. At the end of the article a list of
the best books on the subject shows the
student who desires to specialize just
where to go for further details. No less
than 203,000 books are included in these
lists appended to Britannica articles and
many of them are, in themselves, substantial
contributions to literature. The
Shakespeare bibliography would, for example,
fill 30 pages of the size and type
of this Guide; the bibliography of English
history, by A. F. Pollard, of the University
of London, 13 pages, and the bibliography
of French history, by Prof.
Bémont of the École des Hautes Études,
Paris, 8 pages.</p>

<p class='c007'>A group of articles of great interest to
every student of literature deals with the
methods and appliances by which writings
are preserved and circulated. <span class='sc'>Manuscript</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 618) is by Sir E.
Maunde Thompson, of the British Museum
Library; <span class='sc'>Book</span> (Vol. 4, p. 214);
<span class='sc'>Book-Collecting</span> (Vol. 4, p. 221) and
<span class='sc'>Incunabula</span> (Vol. 14, p. 369) are by A.
W. Pollard, also of the British Museum
Library. <span class='sc'>Libraries</span> (Vol. 16, p. 545),
equivalent to 100 pages of this Guide, is
by H. R. Tedder, librarian of the Athenaeum
Club, London. The articles on
printing, binding, publishing and similar
subjects are described in the chapter of
this Guide <i>For Printers</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this chapter to help him the student
will have little difficulty in devising
his own course of reading in any one literature—starting
with the general treatment,
going from this to the separate
biographies of the great authors mentioned
in the general article, and, when
there is in the national literature that he
is studying some special development of
a literary <i>genre</i>, as of the sermon in the
17th or the satire in the 18th century,
turning to the article in the Britannica
dealing with this form of literature, <span class='sc'>Satire</span>,
<span class='sc'>Sermon</span>, or whatever it may be. For
example, what could be more illuminating
to the student of 19th century literature
than the following passages-disconnected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>here—from the article <span class='sc'>Satire</span>?</p>

<p class='c020'>Goethe and Schiller, Scott and Wadsworth,
are now at hand, and as imagination
gains ground satire declines. Byron, who
in the 18th century would have been the
greatest of satirists, is hurried by the spirit
of his age into passion and description, bequeathing,
however, a splendid proof of the
possibility of allying satire with sublimity
in his <i>Vision of Judgment</i>.... Miss
Edgeworth skirts the confines of satire, and
Miss Austen seasons her novels with the
most exquisite satiric traits. Washington
Irving revives the manner of <i>The Spectator</i>,
and Tieck brings irony and persiflage to
the discussion of critical problems....
In all the characteristics of his genius
Thackeray is thoroughly English, and the
faults and follies he chastises are those especially
characteristic of British society. Good
sense and the perception of the ridiculous
are amalgamated in him; his satire is a
thoroughly British article, a little over-solid,
a little wanting in finish, but honest, weighty
and durable. Posterity must go to him for
the humours of the age of Victoria, as they
go to Addison for those of Anne’s....
In Heine the satiric spirit, long confined to
established literary forms, seems to obtain
unrestrained freedom to wander where it
will, nor have the ancient models been followed
since by any considerable satirist except
the Italian Giusti. The machinery employed
by Moore was indeed transplanted to
America by James Russell Lowell, whose
<i>Biglow Papers</i> represent perhaps the highest
moral level yet attained by satire.</p>

<p class='c020'>In no age was the spirit of satire so generally
diffused as in the 19th century, but
many of its eminent writers, while bordering
on the domains of satire, escape the definition
of satirist. The term cannot be properly
applied to Dickens, the keen observer
of the oddities of human life; or to George
Eliot, the critic of its emptiness when not
inspired by a worthy purpose; or to Balzac,
the painter of French society; or to Trollope,
the mirror of the middle classes of
England. If <i>Sartor Resartus</i> could be regarded
as a satire, Carlyle would rank
among the first of satirists; but the satire,
though very obvious, rather accompanies
than inspires the composition.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVII<br> <span class='c014'>AMERICAN LITERATURE</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The list in the preceding chapter of the key articles dealing with national
literatures shows that the Britannica separately treats the literary products
of some 30 countries. To outline 30 courses of reading, mentioning the 3,000
critical and biographical articles, would make this Guide unwieldy. On pp. 929–937
of Vol. 29 the reader will find classified lists of these articles, and only four groups
are selected here for detailed treatment: those on American, English, German and
Greek literature. The main article in the literature of each of the other countries
indicates the characteristic forms, the typical works of the leading writers discussed
in special articles, so that courses of reading as systematic as these four can easily
be planned for other countries by the reader.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>On English literature, with its
vastly longer history and greater
volume, there is much more matter
in the Britannica than on American

literature. The key article is
<span class='sc'>English Literature</span> (Vol. 9, p. 607;
equivalent to 120 pages of this Guide),
and an excellent outline for the study
of this subject may be based on this
article which should be supplemented
by the sections on <i>Literature</i> in the
articles <span class='sc'>Scotland</span>, <span class='sc'>Canada</span>, etc. A
combination of these with special articles
may be arranged as follows:</p>

by Hugh Chisholm, editor-in
chief of the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
and an elaborate, classified bibliography
by H. R. Tedder, librarian of the Athenaeum
Club, London. In his discussion
of the Baconian theory of the authorship
of the plays Mr. Chisholm says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No such idea seems to have occurred
to anybody till the middle of the 19th
century.... The most competent special
students of Shakespeare, however they
may differ as to details, and also the most
authoritative special students of Bacon,
are unanimous in upholding the traditional
view.” And he adds that as regards
the effort to account for the positive
contemporary evidence in favour of
the identification of the man Shakespeare
with the author of Shakespeare’s works,
“it is highly significant that it was not
attempted or thought of for centuries.”

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XL<br> <span class='c014'>GREEK LITERATURE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>In the article <span class='sc'>Literature</span> in the Britannica,
by Professor James Fitzmaurice-Kelly,
himself a specialist in Spanish
literature, are these sentences:</p>

<p class='c020'>The evolution of literature is completed
in Greece, and there its subdivisions may
best be studied. Epic poetry is represented
by the Homeric cycle, lyric poetry by Tyrtaeus,
dramatic poetry by Aeschylus, history
by Herodotus, oratory by Pericles,
philosophy by Plato, and criticism by Zoilus,
the earliest of slashing reviewers; and in
each department there is a long succession
of illustrative names. Roughly speaking, all
subsequent literature is imitative.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Main Article</div>

<p class='c007'>This testimony to the importance of
Greek literature is all the more weighty
as coming from one whose own field of
criticism is in Romantic literature. The
authority with which such an important
subject as Greek literature is treated in
the Britannica will be apparent to any
classical student who notes the names of
the contributors of the articles mentioned
in the following course of reading.
The key article
<span class='sc'>Greek Literature</span>
(Vol. 12, p. 507;
equivalent to 65
pages of this Guide) is divided into three
sections: Ancient (p. 507), Byzantine (p.
516) and Modern (p. 524). The second
section, by Prof. Karl Krumbacher of
Munich, author of <i>Geschichte der byzantinischen
Literatur</i>, and the third, by J. D.
Bourchier, correspondent of <i>The Times</i>
(London) in South-Eastern Europe, need
not be dwelt upon here. To the ordinary
student, in spite of the increasing interest
shown in Byzantine and modern Hellenic
literature, “Greek literature” must mean
the literature of ancient Greece, and for
him the <i>first</i> part of the article will be the
foundation of his study of the subject.
This section of the article is by the late
Sir Richard C. Jebb, professor of Greek at
Glasgow and then at Cambridge, known
as the biographer of Bentley, as the
author of an excellent brief history of
Greek literature, and as an authority on
subdivisions of that subject so diverse as
rhetoric and oratory on the one side
and lyric and dramatic poetry on the
other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jebb’s article divides ancient Greek
literature into three periods: <i>Early</i>, including
epic, elegiac, iambic and lyric
poetry and coming down to 475 B.C.;
<i>Attic</i>, 475–300 B.C., including tragic and
comic drama and historical, oratorical
and philosophical prose; and <i>Decadence</i>—Alexandrian,
300–146 B.C., and Greco-Roman,
146 B.C.–529 A.D.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Epic</div>

<p class='c007'>In the first of these periods the student
should supplement Professor Jebb’s treatment
in the article <span class='sc'>Greek Literature</span>
by the following articles:
<span class='sc'>Epic Poetry</span> (Vol. 9, p.
681), a general sketch of
the form by Edmund Gosse; <span class='sc'>Homer</span> (Vol.
13, p. 626; equivalent to 40 pages of this
Guide), by the late Prof. David Binning
Monro of Oriel College, Oxford, editor of
Homer and author of <i>Grammar of the
Homeric Dialect</i>,—and on the “Homeric
question” see also the articles <span class='sc'>Aristarchus</span>
and <span class='sc'>F. A. Wolf</span>; <span class='sc'>Hesiod</span> (Vol.
13, p. 407), by James Davies, formerly
head master Ludlow Grammar School,
and John Henry Freese, formerly fellow
St. John’s, Cambridge; <span class='sc'>Cycle</span> (Vol. 7, p.
682; last part of the article); and the
cyclic poets, <span class='sc'>Stasinus</span>, <span class='sc'>Arctinus</span>, <span class='sc'>Lesches</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Creophylus</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Elegy</div>

<p class='c007'>For the elegy see Edmund Gosse’s article
<span class='sc'>Elegy</span>; and on the Greek elegists,
the articles <span class='sc'>Callinus</span> and <span class='sc'>Tyrtæus</span> for
martial poetry, <span class='sc'>Mimnermus</span> for melancholy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>verse, <span class='sc'>Solon</span> for political and
ethical poetry, <span class='sc'>Theognis</span>
and <span class='sc'>Phocylides</span> for the
gnomic elegy, and <span class='sc'>Xenophanes</span>
for the use of the measure in didactic
philosophical verse. On iambic
verse and its Greek writers before the
time of the drama see: <span class='sc'>Iambic</span>, <span class='sc'>Archilochus</span>,
<span class='sc'>Simonides of Amorgos</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Hipponax</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lyric Poetry</div>

<p class='c007'>The third poetic form of the period,
one which unfortunately has come down
to us only in tantalizingly brief fragments—comparable
to the
quotations illustrating
word-usage in
our dictionaries—is the lyric. On this
see the general article <span class='sc'>Lyrical Poetry</span>,
by Edmund Gosse, on this form in different
literatures, and the sketches of the
Greek lyrists the Aeolians <span class='sc'>Alcaeus</span> (see
also the article <span class='sc'>Alcaics</span>) and <span class='sc'>Sappho</span>, by
Prof. John Arthur Platt, University College,
London; <span class='sc'>Praxilla</span> and <span class='sc'>Erinna</span>,
Sappho’s rivals as lyric poetesses; the
Ionian <span class='sc'>Anacreon</span> (see also the article
<span class='sc'>Anacreontics</span>, by Edmund Gosse); the
Dorian <span class='sc'>Alcman</span>; <span class='sc'>Stesichorus</span>, <span class='sc'>Arion</span>
and <span class='sc'>Ibycus</span>; <span class='sc'>Simonides</span>, who may be
called Panhellenic; <span class='sc'>Pindar</span> (Vol. 21, p.
617; equivalent to 10 pages of this Guide,
by Sir R. C. Jebb), the only Greek lyrist
whose work has come down to us in any
considerable quantity, and whose poems
are such remarkable examples of metrical
structure; <span class='sc'>Bacchylides</span> (Vol. 3, p. 121;
equivalent to 9 pages of this Guide; also
by Sir R. C. Jebb, who was one of the
first editors), Pindar’s rival, whose poems
until a few years ago were known to us
only by brief quotations by grammarians,
but who had the good luck to survive in
papyrus lately found in Egypt; and
<span class='sc'>Timotheus</span> of Miletus, of whose “Persians”
a valuable fragment was found in
1903 in what seems to be the oldest papyrus
in existence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Attic Literature</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Comedy</div>

<p class='c007'>The Attic period has two important developments—the
drama, tragic and comic,
and the beginnings of a Greek prose.
For the drama read the part of Prof.
A. W. Ward’s article
<span class='sc'>Drama</span> dealing
with the Greek period
(Vol. 8, pp. 488–493),
and the article <span class='sc'>Comedy</span>; and the articles
on the great dramatists:—the tragedians
<span class='sc'>Thespis</span>, <span class='sc'>Choerilus</span>, <span class='sc'>Phrynichus</span> and
<span class='sc'>Pratinas</span> in the earlier period; <span class='sc'>Aeschylus</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 272; equivalent to 12 pages
of this Guide), by Arthur Sidgwick, fellow
of Corpus Christi, Oxford, and editor
of the Oxford text of Aeschylus; <span class='sc'>Sophocles</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 424; equivalent to 12
pages of this Guide), by Lewis Campbell,
editor and translator of this poet; and
<span class='sc'>Euripides</span> (Vol. 9, p. 901; equivalent to
15 pages of this Guide), in the main by
Sir R. C. Jebb; and the comic poets,—the
Sicilian <span class='sc'>Epicharmus</span>; the
representatives of the Attic
Old Comedy, <span class='sc'>Cratinus</span>,
<span class='sc'>Crates</span>, <span class='sc'>Pherecrates</span>, <span class='sc'>Eupolis</span>, <span class='sc'>Phrynichus</span>
(not to be confused with the
tragic poet of that name), <span class='sc'>Magnes</span>,
<span class='sc'>Plato</span> (to be distinguished from the philosopher),—all
these known to us only by
allusions and chance quotations—and
<span class='sc'>Aristophanes</span> (Vol. 2, p. 499; equivalent
to 7 pages of this Guide, by Sir R. C.
Jebb), the only Greek poet of whom we
have complete plays and probably the
greatest of the writers of Greek comedy;
the names—they are little more—of
<span class='sc'>Eubulus</span>, <span class='sc'>Antiphanes</span>, <span class='sc'>Alexis</span> in the
Middle Comedy; and in the New Comedy
or third period, <span class='sc'>Philemon</span>, <span class='sc'>Menander</span>
(by J. H. Freese), who was so highly
esteemed and so constantly pilfered from
by the Roman comic writers, and of whose
plays large fragments have been found in
the last few years; <span class='sc'>Diphilus</span>, <span class='sc'>Apollodorus</span>
of Carystus, <span class='sc'>Posidippus</span>, <span class='sc'>Rhinthon</span>
and <span class='sc'>Sotades</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>History</div>

<p class='c007'>The prose of the Attic period we may
divide roughly into history, oratory and
philosophy. On the historians
read <span class='sc'>Logographi</span>,
<span class='sc'>Greece</span>, <i>Ancient History</i>,
“Authorities” (Vol. 12, p. 454), with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>criticism of the historical accuracy of
Herodotus, Thucydides, Diodorus, Plutarch,
Xenophon, etc., <span class='sc'>Hecataeus</span> of
Miletus, <span class='sc'>Herodotus</span> (Vol. 13, p. 381;
equivalent to 10 pages of this Guide), by
the historian George Rawlinson and E. M.
Walker, librarian of Queen’s College, Oxford;

<span class='sc'>Timaeus</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Oratory</div>

<p class='c007'>On Attic orators read <span class='sc'>Andocides</span>,
<span class='sc'>Lysias</span>, <span class='sc'>Isocrates</span>, <span class='sc'>Isaeus</span>, <span class='sc'>Antiphon</span>,
<span class='sc'>Demosthenes</span>, <span class='sc'>Aeschines</span>, <span class='sc'>Hypereides</span>,—most
of these articles
being by Sir R. C. Jebb,
who was particularly versed
in this branch of Greek literature. The
special student of the orators should read
also the articles <span class='sc'>Greek Law</span> (Vol. 12, p.
501; equivalent to 15 pages in this Guide),
by Prof. J. E. Sandys of Cambridge, author
of <i>A History of Classical Scholarship</i>,

<p class='c007'>On Greek philosophical writing see the
articles <span class='sc'>Pherecydes</span> of Syros, <span class='sc'>Anaximenes</span>

see the chapter in this Guide on <i>Philosophy</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Decadence</div>

<p class='c007'>The third period of classical Greek literature
was one of Greek thought in unGreek
surroundings—see the article <span class='sc'>Hellenism</span>,
by E. R. Bevan, author of
<i>The House of Seleucus</i>, etc.,—and this
came to its first and
finest flower in Alexandria,
in Egypt,
under the Ptolemies—see the article
<span class='sc'>Alexandrian School</span>, especially that
part of it dealing with <i>Literature</i> (Vol. 1,
p. 573). On the writers of the Alexandrian
period see: for poetry, <span class='sc'>Philetas</span>,
<span class='sc'>Hermesianax</span>, <span class='sc'>Asclepiades</span> of Samos,
and the comic poets <span class='sc'>Sotades</span> and <span class='sc'>Rhinthon</span>,
already mentioned; <span class='sc'>Herodas</span>, by
W. G. Headlam, editor of Herodas; the
idyllist <span class='sc'>Theocritus</span> (Vol. 26, p. 760),
by A. C. Clark, fellow of Queen’s, Oxford;
Theocritus’s followers <span class='sc'>Bion</span> and <span class='sc'>Moschus</span>;
the mythologist <span class='sc'>Callimachus</span>,
who influenced Catullus as much as
Theocritus did the young Virgil; the
didactic poet <span class='sc'>Aratus</span>, whom Cicero
translated into Latin and whom Virgil
imitated in his <i>Georgics</i>; the epic <span class='sc'>Apollonius</span>
of Rhodes, and the late tragedian
<span class='sc'>Lycophron</span>; and for prose the critic
<span class='sc'>Aristarchus</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Greco-Roman period, following
the Alexandrian the principal articles for
the student are: the historians <span class='sc'>Polybius</span>
and <span class='sc'>Diodorus Siculus</span>, the satirist
<span class='sc'>Lucian</span>, the later historians <span class='sc'>Dionysius
Halicarnassensis</span>, <span class='sc'>Dio Cassius</span>, <span class='sc'>Arrian</span>,
<span class='sc'>Appian</span>, <span class='sc'>Herodian</span>, <span class='sc'>Eusebius</span>,
<span class='sc'>Zosimus</span>, the biographers <span class='sc'>Plutarch</span>,
<span class='sc'>Diogenes Laertius</span>, <span class='sc'>Philostratus</span>, the
rhetoricians <span class='sc'>Longinus</span> and <span class='sc'>Dio Chrysostom</span>,
and the emperor philosopher
<span class='sc'>Marcus Aurelius</span> and his forerunner
the “slave philosopher” <span class='sc'>Epictetus</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Possibly the most typical output of the
later Greek age is the matchless collection
of short poems known to us as “the

<span class='sc'>Epigram</span> and <span class='sc'>Anthology</span>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLI<br> <span class='c014'>BIBLE STUDY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>It is impossible for the student to
consider the subject of Bible Study
without being impressed by the immense
labour and the profound scholarship
which have been devoted to the
interpretation and discussion of Scripture.
Continued investigation has solved many
difficulties, but has also vastly increased
the mass of evidences and conjectures
which must be weighed in connection
with any doubtful passages. The Britannica
tells us, for example, (Vol. 3,
pp. 903, 904) that the translators of the
King James’s version spent only two
years and nine months over their task,
while the work on the Revised Version
took eleven years for the New Testament
and fourteen for the Old Testament.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Bible as a Focus of Thought</div>

<p class='c007'>It is equally true that all the time
which learned men have given to translating
and elucidating the text seems
nothing when it is
compared with the
time that mankind
at large have spent
in reading it. But
the Britannica mentions a report of the
great English Bible Society, the “British
and Foreign,” in which the copies circulated
by it are totalled at more than
198 million, and, for the American Bible
Society and its federated associations,
it gives a total of more than 84 million
copies (Vol. 3, p. 907). It has often
been said that the English Bible is the
only example of a translation that became
more famous than the original,
and it is as true that no other translation
has been the source of so many
secondary translations, for versions in
no less than 530 distinct languages and
dialects have been derived from the English
text. It is interesting to note, although
in this case the English version
has certainly nothing to do with the
matter, that “in Italy, by a departure
from the traditional policy of the Roman
Church, the newly formed, ‘Pious Society
of St. Jerome for the Dissemination of
the Holy Gospels’ issued in 1901, from
the Vatican press, a new Italian version
of the Four Gospels and <i>Acts</i>,” and sold
400,000 copies at 4 cents each.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a sort of threshold-study, it will
be well to consider three topics: Hebrew
Literature, Hebrew Religion and Biblical
History.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Preliminaries</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hebrew Literature</span> (Vol. 13, p.
169), by Dr. Arthur Cowley, of the
Bodleian Library, Oxford, points out
that the term “Hebrew
Literature” is
loosely used of “all
works written in
Hebrew characters,
whether the language be Aramaic, Arabic,
or even some vernacular not related to
Hebrew;” and that “this literature begins
with, as it is almost entirely based
upon, the Old Testament.” This article
on Hebrew Literature may be supplemented
by the following articles:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Targum</span>, by John Frederick Stenning,

<div class='sidenote'>Hebrew Religion</div>

<p class='c007'>Quite as important is the article <span class='sc'>Hebrew
Religion</span> (Vol. 13, p. 176), by
the Rev. Dr. Owen Charles Whitehouse
of Christ’s and Cheshunt
Colleges, Cambridge.
His treatment
of the subject
is comparative and historical. There
is an interesting summary of what is
known and may be inferred about pre-Mosaic
religion; and it is important to
notice that the author does not consider
that the plural Elohim used in certain
Old Testament passages to mean “God”
is to be understood as “a comprehensive
expression for the multitude of gods
embraced in the One God of Old Testament
religion,” but explains the plural
as one “of majesty” like the “we” of
royalty. Blood-offerings and magic
charms against demons and jinns may
be assumed as belonging to the early
Hebrew religion as to the later Arabian
period before Mahomet. Dr. Whitehouse
thinks that there is little or no
trace of totemism but possibly some of
ancestor-worship in the Jews’ religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the many articles supplementing
this general treatment of Hebrew
religion the following are possibly the
most important:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Biblical History</div>

<p class='c007'>The third topic is history and for
this the student should read the article
<span class='sc'>Jews</span> (Vol. 15, p. 371), especially the
part on <i>Old Testament History</i>,
by S. A. Cook; the
article <span class='sc'>Palestine</span>, <i>Physical
Features</i>, by R. A. S. Macalister,
director of excavations for the
Palestine Exploration Fund, <i>Old Testament

the treatment of Biblical Religion (pp.
610–611 of Vol. 20); <span class='sc'>Canaan</span>, by Dr.
Thomas Kelly Cheyne, formerly Oriel
professor of interpretation of Scripture,
Oxford; <span class='sc'>Hittites</span>, by D. G. Hogarth,
keeper of the Ashmolean Museum,

<div class='sidenote'>The Article Bible</div>

<p class='c007'>But of course the central article for the
Bible student is the article <span class='sc'>Bible</span> (Vol.
3, p. 849), which is divided into two
main parts—<i>Old
Testament</i> and <i>New
Testament</i>, each of
these being divided
in turn into five parts: Canon, Texts and
Versions, Textual Criticism, Higher Criticism,
and Chronology. This logical
arrangement greatly enhances the value
of the article, which is in itself an excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>summary of the subject written
by the following authorities: Dr. Samuel
Rolles Driver, professor of Hebrew,
Oxford, on Old Testament canon and
chronology; John Frederick Stenning,
dean of Wadham College, Oxford, and
lecturer in Aramaic, on Old Testament
texts and versions; Dr. George Buchanan
Gray, professor of Hebrew and Old
Testament exegesis, Mansfield College,
Oxford, on Old Testament textual and
higher criticism; Dr. William Sanday,
professor of Divinity and canon of
Christ Church, Oxford, on New Testament
canon; the Rev. Kirsopp Lake,
author of <i>The Text of the New Testament</i>,
etc., and professor of New Testament
exegesis at Leiden, on New Testament
texts and versions and textual criticism;
Dr. Francis Crawford Burkitt, professor
of divinity, Cambridge, and author of
<i>The Gospel History and its Transmission</i>,
etc., on New Testament higher criticism;
and Cuthbert Hamilton Turner, of
Magdalen College, Oxford, on New Testament
chronology.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Bible, English</span> (Vol. 3,
p. 894), by Anna C. Paues, author of
<i>A Fourteenth Century Biblical Version</i>,
and Canon Henson of Westminster
Abbey (on the Revised Version) is accompanied
by a plate with fac-similes of
several early English Bibles and is
besides of special value as giving quotations
from different versions in Anglo-Saxon
and later English. The article
<span class='sc'>Bible Societies</span> (Vol. 3, p. 905), by the
Rev. Thomas Herbert Darlow, literary
superintendent of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, will also be of value
to the student.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Inspiration</div>

<p class='c007'>One other general article should be
studied before the articles on different
books of the Bible are taken up. This is—<span class='sc'>Inspiration</span>
(Vol. 14, p. 645), by Dr.
Alfred Ernest Garvie,
author of <i>Studies
in the Inner Life of
Jesus</i>; it outlines the principal theories of
inspiration—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Mechanical dictation or verbal inspiration;</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Dynamic influence or degrees of
inspiration;</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Essential inspiration, distinguishing
matters of doctrine and conduct from
the remaining contents of Scripture;</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) Vital inspiration, emphasizing religious
and moral life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Hexateuch</div>

<p class='c007'>A course of study in the books of the
Bible may well start with the outline
in the article <span class='sc'>Bible</span>,

the brief article <span class='sc'>Hexateuch</span>; then what

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>John the Baptist</span>, <span class='sc'>Herod Antipas</span>,
<span class='sc'>Salome</span>, <span class='sc'>Joseph</span> (Vol. 15, p. 513, col. 2),

<span class='sc'>Gethsemane</span>, <span class='sc'>Pilate</span>, <span class='sc'>Calvary</span>, <span class='sc'>Joseph
of Arimathaea</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In studying the separate Gospels, let
the reader follow the order suggested in
the articles <span class='sc'>Gospel</span> and <span class='sc'>Jesus Christ</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>First he should study the article <span class='sc'>Mark,
Gospel of</span>, by Dr. Stanton; the article
on <span class='sc'>St. Mark</span>, by Dr. James Vernon
Bartlett, professor of Church History,
Mansfield College, Oxford, and, for a
summary of the points in the Marcan or
Galilean narrative as contrasted with
the Jerusalem narrative in regard to the
betrayal of Jesus and the period immediately
following, the article on <span class='sc'>St. Peter</span>
by Dr. Kirsopp Lake.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Matthew, Gospel of St.</span>, by Dr.
Vincent H. Stanton, and <span class='sc'>Matthew</span>, by
Dr. J. V. Bartlett; with particular attention
to the paragraph on additions to
Mark’s narrative in Vol. 15, p. 355, and
to the stress on the Messianic character,
the mention of the church and of St. Peter
as the Rock in chapter 16.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Luke, Gospel of St.</span>, by Dr. Stanton,
and the biographical sketch of <span class='sc'>Luke</span>, by
Dr. Bartlett; and the paragraph on
Luke’s additions to Mark’s narrative in
Vol. 15, p. 356. This is the universal
gospel, just as Mark’s was for extra-Palestinian
use and Matthew’s particularly
for the Jew, as is shown by the incidents
of Zaccheus and of the Samaritan
leper; and Renan’s characterization of
the gospel of the one evangelist who was
not a Jew, “the most beautiful book in
the world,” is quoted twice in the Britannica.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>John, Gospel of St.</span>, and <span class='sc'>John</span> (the
Apostle), both by Baron Friedrich von
Hügel, author of <i>The Mystical Element of
Religion</i>: the paragraph on the distinctive
elements of John’s gospel (in Vol. 15, p.
357), such as the story of John the Baptist
(see the article on this “forerunner,”
by G. H. Box, late lecturer in theology,
Oxford); the philosophical prologue (see
the article <span class='sc'>Logos</span>, by the late Rev. Dr.
Stewart Dingwall Fordyce Salmon, professor
of systematic theology, United
Free Church College, Aberdeen, and the
Rev. A. J. Grieve, professor of New Testament
and church history, Yorkshire
United Independent College, Bradford);
the Judean scene as contrasted with the
predominance of Galilee and Samaria in
the other three (synoptic) gospels, and
the prominence given to great abstract
ideas and symbols—the Light of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>World, the Living Bread, the Only-Begotten,
the Re-Birth, Eternal Life, the
Way, the Truth, and the Life, Water and
Wine, the Paraclete, and the refrain and
variations on the theme of Love.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before studying the articles dealing
with the book of <span class='sc'>Acts</span>, let the reader
consult Dr. Garvie’s article <span class='sc'>Miracle</span>, for
a study of the supernatural and particularly
for a development of the argument
for miracles from “the congruity of
the miracle with divine truth and grace”;
the miracles of Jesus, and of the apostles,
consist in “the relief of need, the removal
of suffering, the recovery of health and
strength.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Acts</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Acts of the Apostles</span>, by
Dr. J. Vernon Bartlett, should be supplemented
by referring again to the article
<span class='sc'>Luke</span>, and the student
should call to mind that
the probable author was not
a Jew, was a personal friend and traveling
companion of both Paul and Peter, and
was a physician, a trained scientific observer,
as can be seen not only from his
descriptions of disease, but from his accuracy
in geographical, meteorological
and other matters. The importance of
the testimony of the physician to the
miracles of the apostles is brought out
(p. 164, top of column 2) in the article on
the book. For the study of <span class='sc'>Acts</span>, besides
the article on the book, read the
following separate articles:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Luke</span>, <span class='sc'>Peter</span>, <span class='sc'>John</span>, <span class='sc'>Judas</span>, <span class='sc'>Aceldama</span>,
<span class='sc'>Matthias</span>, <span class='sc'>Pentecost</span>, <span class='sc'>Tongues,
Gift of</span>; <span class='sc'>Ananias</span>, <span class='sc'>Gamaliel</span>, <span class='sc'>Stephen</span>,
<span class='sc'>Simon Magus</span>, <span class='sc'>Philip</span>, <span class='sc'>Paul</span>, <span class='sc'>Joppa</span>, <span class='sc'>Antioch</span>,
<span class='sc'>Herod</span>, <span class='sc'>Barnabas</span>, <span class='sc'>Iconium</span>, <span class='sc'>Lycaonia</span>,
<span class='sc'>Mark</span>, <span class='sc'>Timothy</span>, <span class='sc'>Silas</span>, <span class='sc'>Philippi</span>,
<span class='sc'>Thessalonica</span>, <span class='sc'>Athens</span>, <span class='sc'>Areopagus</span>,
<span class='sc'>Corinth</span>, <span class='sc'>Aquila</span>, <span class='sc'>Apollos</span>, <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span>,
<span class='sc'>Felix</span>, <span class='sc'>Ananias</span>, <span class='sc'>Agrippa</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St. Paul</div>

<p class='c007'>For a study of the book of Acts, which
was probably written before any one of
the Gospels, one will
need constantly to
refer in the Britannica
to the article on <span class='sc'>Paul, the Apostle</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 938), by Dr. J. Vernon
Bartlett. This article, equivalent to
55 pages in this Guide, is so important
that it will be well to outline it
here. After an introduction, in which
Paul’s attitude toward Jewish legalism is
made an explanation of the superficially
obvious contrast between Jesus and Paul,
there is a biographical sketch: Paul of
Tarsus, a Roman citizen with Roman
name, talking Latin and not a narrow,
one-sided Jew; his Jewish training; in
Jerusalem, under Gamaliel (see the article
<span class='sc'>Gamaliel</span>); first impressions as to
Jesus, and Saul as persecutor; the vision
at Damascus and its spiritual content;
his new theory of the law and its universal
value; Christology of Paul,—his deep insight
into Jesus’s character; Paul’s theology
rooted in experience; his early apostolate;
his first missionary journey; the
issue of Gentile Christianity raised;
Paul’s conciliatory spirit; Peter’s visit to
Antioch; Paul’s protest; the second mission
tour; Paul in Europe—Athens, Corinth,
etc.; first missionary letters; as an
ethical teacher; Paul, the Law, the Spirit;
later travels; later letters; Paulinism—its
Christocentric character; apparent contrasts
and contradictions between Paul’s
gospel and Jesus’s gospel—one seen
through the eyes of a conscious sinner,
the other the sinless consciousness of the
Saviour; Paul’s position between Judaeo-Christianity
and Gnosticism—see also
the article <span class='sc'>Gnosticism</span>, by Wilhelm
Bousset, professor of New Testament
exegesis, Göttingen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Pauline Epistles</div>

<p class='c007'>In general on the Pauline epistles the
student should not only read this article
<span class='sc'>Paul</span>, but should turn again to the treatment
of New Testament
canon in the article
<span class='sc'>Bible</span> (Vol. 3,
pp. 872–873), and
should look over the first part of the article
<span class='sc'>Jesus Christ</span> which finds in 1st
Thessalonians the earliest extant document
of Christianity. Then let him read
the articles:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span><span class='sc'>Thessalonians, Epistles to the</span>, by

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Romans, Epistle to the</span>, by Dr.

the articles on <span class='sc'>Colossians</span> and on 1st
<span class='sc'>Peter</span> for textual criticism; the article
<span class='sc'>Marriage</span> for Paul’s influence (Eph. ch.
5, v. 23–32) on the Church’s attitude
toward marriage; and the article <span class='sc'>Gnosticism</span>
for the tendency in the church
which Paul attacked in this epistle and
in Colossians.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Colossians</span>, by Prof. J. E. Frame; the
article <span class='sc'>Colossae</span>; <span class='sc'>Angel</span> (on chap. 2, v.

the “knowledge falsely so-called” of 1
Tim. 6, 20), and the article <span class='sc'>Pastoral
Epistles</span> on these letters and on that to

<span class='sc'>Messiah</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Other Epistles</div>

<p class='c007'>Before turning to the articles on the
other books of the New Testament, let
the student read a part of the article
<span class='sc'>Theology</span>, by the
Rev. Dr. Robert
Mackintosh of the
Lancashire Independent
College, Manchester, with special
attention to the paragraphs (end of p.
773 and p. 774, Vol. 26) on Jewish theology,
St. Paul and contents of the New
Testament. Here “Paulinism” is shown
not merely in the Pauline writings but in
the Acts, in 1st Peter (“good independent
Paulinism”), and even in the Apocalypse,
at least as regards the atonement
and Christology. “The Johannine Gospel
and Epistles are later than Paulinism,
and presuppose its leading or less startling
positions.” And the same article
(p. 783) after pointing out that Luther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>and the evangelical revival “went back
to St. Paul” asks “can Christianity not
dig deeper by going back to Jesus?” The
writer also suggests that the German
school of Ritschl in “not idolizing Paulinism”
have “idolized Luther.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The other principal topics to be studied
are:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>James, Epistle of</span>, by the Rev. Dr.
Benjamin Wisner Bacon, professor of
New Testament criticism and exegesis,
Yale; the article on <span class='sc'>James</span> by the Rev.
Dr. George Milligan, Professor of divinity
and Biblical criticism, Glasgow; and
the articles <span class='sc'>Revelation</span>, <span class='sc'>Clement</span>, <span class='sc'>Hermas</span>,
etc., for the question of date and
relation with other writings; <span class='sc'>Wisdom
Literature</span>, for earlier writings on the
“Wisdom” and proverbial expressions of
chapter 3; <span class='sc'>Matthew</span>, for a similar view
of the gospel and the Church; and on
“Justification,” vol. 20, p. 954, in article
<span class='sc'>Paul</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Peter, Epistles of</span>, by Dr. Kirsopp
Lake; the article on <span class='sc'>St. Peter</span>, by the
same scholar. For a date earlier than
that of the Epistle of James, see the article
on that book. See also <span class='sc'>Romans</span> and
<span class='sc'>Polycarp</span> to supplement what is here
said of the relations of 1st Peter to these
writings; and <span class='sc'>Eschatology</span> on the expected
“second coming” of 2nd Peter,
chapter 3, vs. 1–13, and <span class='sc'>Jude, Epistle
of</span>, on its relation to this book.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jude, Epistle of</span>, by Prof. B. W.
Bacon of Yale; the article on <span class='sc'>Hegesippus</span>,
the authority for the little we know
of Jude; the articles <span class='sc'>Eschatology</span> (for
“the last time” of verse 18), <span class='sc'>Angel</span>
(for vs. 6, 9), <span class='sc'>Michael</span>, and especially
the articles <span class='sc'>Apocryphal Literature</span>;
<span class='sc'>Moses, Assumption of</span>; and
<span class='sc'>Enoch, Book of</span>, for the allusions in
verses 9 and 14.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the head of Johannine are
grouped, besides the fourth gospel, the
three epistles of John and the Revelation.
On these see:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Johannine Writings</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>John, The Epistles of</span>, by Dr.
Moffatt, and the article on St. John in
regard to authorship,
which may more
probably be assigned
to John the presbyter;
and the articles <span class='sc'>Antichrist</span> (on 1
John, 2, 22), <span class='sc'>Gnosticism</span> (for chap. 3,
vs. 4–7), etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Revelation, Book of</span>, by the Rev.
Dr. Robert Henry Charles, lecturer in
Biblical studies, Oxford. This book, and
this article, should be studied in connection
with the article, also by Dr. Charles,
on <span class='sc'>Apocalyptic Literature</span>, and the
canonical apocalyptic passages in Mark
13, Mathew 24, Luke 21 and 2nd Thessalonians
2, as well as the extra-canonical
apocalypses described in <span class='sc'>Apocalyptic
Literature</span> and in the separate articles
<span class='sc'>Isaiah, Ascension of</span>, and <span class='sc'>Hermas,
Shepherd of</span>. Besides see the articles
<span class='sc'>Eschatology</span>, <span class='sc'>Millenium</span>. The student
should read the article <span class='sc'>Nero</span>, even if
“666” does not certainly refer to him, and
the articles <span class='sc'>Domitian</span> and <span class='sc'>Vespasian</span> on
the possibility that one of them may have
been “the beast that was and is not,&#160;...
himself also an eighth” (see footnote on
p. 220, Vol. 23).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Apocryphal Literature</div>

<p class='c007'>As an epilogue the student should read
the articles <span class='sc'>Apocryphal Literature</span>,
both of the Old and New Testament periods,
by Dr. Charles
and at least the first
part, by Dr. A. C.
McGiffert of Union
Theological Seminary, New York City,
of the article <span class='sc'>Church History</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Biblical Encyclopaedia</div>

<p class='c007'>The study outline sketched in this
chapter will give the student some idea
of the possibilities of the Britannica in
helping him. The
list of articles dealing
with the Bible
on pp. 944–945 of the
Index (Vol. 29) will show that in the
Britannica there is an adequate and
excellent encyclopaedia of the Bible or
text-book of Bible Study.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLII<br> <span class='c014'>HISTORY, INTRODUCTORY AND GENERAL</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>When you turn to the new
Britannica to study history, you
naturally expect to learn a great
deal that will be new to you. But you
can anticipate something more and better
than that. You will find a great deal that
is new to <i>everyone</i>, even to those who
have been reading history for years. For
the contributors to the work, in making a
completely fresh survey of the whole field
of human knowledge, were helping one
another to obtain new light upon the
history of even the earliest periods. As
all the articles were completed before a
single volume was printed, there was
such an opportunity for comparison and
revision as has never before existed.
When research upon one subject had disclosed
new evidence that was of value in
relation to another subject, the contributors
and editors could co-operate as
fully as if they had all been assembled in
a great international congress. And the
result of this collaboration is that the
publication of the new Britannica does
more, at one stroke, to advance historical
knowledge, to solve historical doubts, and
to correct historical mistakes than is done
by isolated historians in the course of a
generation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Authority</div>

<p class='c007'>With this idea of <i>combined</i> effort
clearly before you, consider for a moment
the accumulated individual authority
of such individual
specialists as those who
deal with history in the
Britannica. There are, to name only a few,
the Germans Eduard Meyer and Schiemann
of Berlin, Hashagen of Bonn, von
Pastor of Innsbruck, Pauli of Göttingen,
Keutgen of Hamburg, and Count Lützow;
Frenchmen like Mgr. Duchesne,
Luchaire, Valois, Anchel, Halphen, Babelon
and Bémont; the Italians Villari,
Barnabei and Balzani; the Canadians
Doughty, Grant, Dionne and Wrong;
among Americans, J. H. Robinson, W. A.
Dunning, H. L. Osgood, C. H. Hayes, G.
W. Botsford, and J. T. Shotwell of Columbia;
President Emeritus Charles W.
Eliot, and Drs. Edward Channing, F. J.
Turner and Charles Gross of Harvard;
Drs. A. D. Morse, R. B. Richardson and
Preserved Smith of Amherst; Dr. T. F.
Collier of Williams; Professors William
Graham Sumner, G. Burton Adams and J.
C. Schwab of Yale; Prof. Grant Showerman
of Wisconsin; Prof. William MacDonald
of Brown; Profs. Fleming and
Scroggs of Louisiana; Dr. McMaster of
Pennsylvania; Prof. I. J. Cox of Cincinnati;
the late Alexander Johnston of
Princeton; Prof. W. Roy Smith of Bryn
Mawr; Henry Cabot Lodge, Carl Schurz
and James Ford Rhodes; and—to mention
only a few English names—S. R.
Gardiner, Edward Freeman, Thomas
Hodgkin, James Bryce, James Gairdner,
J. D. Bury, C. W. C. Oman, A. F. Pollard,
J. H. Round, H. W. C. Davis, Osmund
Airy, G. W. Prothero, John Morley,
Reginald Lane Poole, J. Holland

Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace, R.
Nisbet Bain, W. Warde Fowler, J. L.
Myres, J. S. Reid, W. J. Brodribb and
H. F. Pelham.</p>

<p class='c007'>So much for the quality of the historical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>matter in the Britannica. The
quantity is equally remarkable.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>If the history in the Britannica
was printed in the usual volumes
on heavy paper, containing
100,000 words to a volume,
it would fill about 70 such volumes,
or, say, four good-sized
shelves in an ordinary “unit”
bookcase.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Method of Treatment</div>

<p class='c007'>Every country and every event from
the earliest syllable of recorded time receives
its proper treatment. Under such
circumstances it is obvious
that in the limits
of this Guide it would
not be possible to give
outlines of courses of historical readings
for all nations and periods. Such
readings in history alone would more
than fill this whole Guide. But the
information is all in the Britannica, and
what has been said above will give the
reader some notion of the authority of
the articles written by natives of nearly
every civilized country in the world, and
some idea of the scope of treatment. The
character of the subject matter of history
and the method of treatment in the Britannica
combine to make minute outlines
less necessary for historical study than
for the pursuit of a course in almost any
other subject. The Britannica, the student
will quickly see, contains in each
instance a “key” article on the history of
each nation—either as a separate article,
like <span class='sc'>English History</span> or <span class='sc'>Roman History</span>
or as a historical section of the article
on the country—for instance, in the
article <span class='sc'>Greece</span> there is a “sub-article,”
so to say, on history (Vol. 12, pp. 440–470),
and in the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>
a sub-article on American history (Vol.
27, pp. 663–735). The student of any
country’s history should read <i>first</i> such
an article or sub-article, so that he will
get a big outline view of the subject, and
then use it as a basis or starting point for
further reading, looking up in the Index
volume the important topics mentioned
in the main article. These will be:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Articles on the history of parts of
the country he is studying—states, provinces,
counties, kingdoms, duchies, cities
and towns.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Biographies of rulers, statesmen,
soldiers, reformers, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Articles on wars and battles, each
under its proper heading.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) Articles on movements and changes,
sometimes of national, sometimes of international
importance, the Renaissance,
political parties, economic, political and
religious revolutions, the Crusades, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) Articles on churches, sects and
denominations of historical importance
in the country under consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>But although it is impossible to give in
this Guide complete courses of reading
for the history of all countries, it is possible
and desirable to give it in cases
where it would be most useful to the
greatest number of readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following chapter is an outline
course of study in the <i>History of the United
States</i>, which is given in some detail, because
it has a peculiar interest to Americans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next is given an outline of a course of
reading in Canadian and then in English
History, then in French History, and
then in the History of the countries of
the Far East, India, China and Japan.
These will show the reader how fully and
authoritatively the history of countries,
whether near or distant, is given in the
Britannica; and if he wishes to pursue his
studies into the record of other countries,
it is certain that with these for
an example, and with the aid of the
Index, he will have no trouble in so
doing.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLIII<br> <span class='c014'>AMERICAN HISTORY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The plan adopted in most of the
chapters of this Guide is to give
a separate account of each of the
more important articles on the subject to
which the chapter is devoted. But in the
case of American history, the articles are
so numerous, and are so accurately dovetailed
to make a continuous story, that
the reader’s convenience has been better
served by reversing this process, and
grouping the articles under the periods
with which they deal. The reader is thus
enabled to turn at once to any one of the
outstanding episodes of the story, and to
find explicit references to those parts of
the Britannica in which the narrative is
continued from one article to another.
The summary has been put in the form
of a table, in order that its contents may
more easily be surveyed. There is a
much fuller summary, in narrative form,
in the Britannica itself in the historical
portion of the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>
(Vol. 27, pp. 663–735). This is the most
complete condensed history of the country
that has ever been written. It is not
quite so long as this entire Guide; but
from each of its 412 sections the reader
can turn to articles describing in detail
the events consecutively outlined.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been taken for granted that the
reader will recognize the natural connection
between this and other chapters of
the Guide. For example, no attempt has
been made in this chapter to indicate the
articles, elsewhere described, which discuss
the history of American industries
and commerce, railroads and shipping,
finance and economics, art and literature.
Again, the particular history of a
city, town, or river may be of the greatest
interest in itself, although the events
with which its name is associated were
not so typical of any period as to give the
article a place in the present chapter.
Similarly, the numerous and elaborate
American biographies are represented, in
this chapter, only by the names of the
foremost statesmen and soldiers of the
periods included in the table. In short,
the articles named are so few, in proportion
to all those which directly relate to
American history, that the general effect
is to make the space which the Britannica
devotes to the subject seem less than
it really is. But it is not the purpose of
this Guide to impress upon the reader the
magnitude of the volumes he is using.
In that respect the Britannica speaks for
itself. The table instances a few of the
main topics of American history, in order
to show the reader how he may plan
fuller courses of reading by combining
other articles on the principle indicated
by these illustrations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The left hand columns present a brief
outline of the main periods and aspects
of American history. The right hand
columns give the titles of the articles to
be read, the page numbers as well as the
volume numbers (so that when the reference
is to only one section of a long article
the reader can find it at once) and
the names of the contributors.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>This sketch of American History closes
with the inauguration of President Roosevelt,
for the questions that have arisen
since that date are questions into which
current politics enter, and these are
treated in the chapter of this Guide on
<i>Questions of the Day</i>. Here we need only
say that throughout his study of American
history the reader will constantly—and
easily—find many more articles bearing
on the subject than are mentioned in
the outline given above. In particular
let him note:</p>

<p class='c007'>—that there are many biographies of
figures prominent in nation and state not
mentioned above;</p>

<p class='c007'>—that in each article devoted to a
state there is a section on history, which
has a double value, as giving the outline
of the state’s history and as showing its
part in the history of the nation;</p>

<p class='c007'>—and that there is in articles on cities
and towns a great deal of important information
of historical value, sometimes
merely local, but oftener bearing on the
history of state or nation, or both.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLIV<br> <span class='c014'>CANADIAN HISTORY</span></h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>“Young” Rivers and Lakes</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>All the world thinks of Canada as
the youngest of countries, for the
extraordinary rapidity with which
her western territory has been developed
within recent years surpasses every other
record of agricultural expansion. But in
order to realize how young Canada is, in
another sense, one must examine the less
familiar facts of her geological history.
“The innumerable lakes and waterfalls,”
says the Britannica (Vol. 5, p. 143), prove
“that the rivers have not been long at
work,” and that the country owes its
contours to comparatively recent geological
action. “In many cases the lakes
of Canada simply
spill over, at the
lowest point, from
one basin into the
next below, since in so young a country
there has not yet been time for the rivers
to have carved wide valleys.... Thousands
of these lakes have been mapped;
and every new survey brings to light
small lakes hitherto unknown to the
white man.... For the great extent of
lake-filled country there is no comparison”
in any part of the world. And because
the rivers have not yet worn their beds
to an even slope, there are waterfalls
enough to provide unlimited horse power;
so that the natural advantages of Canada
invite manufacturing just as the fertility
of her soil invites agriculture.</p>

<p class='c007'>The geographical and geological portions
of the article <span class='sc'>Canada</span> (Vol. 5, p.
142) must be carefully read in order that
the significance of the historical account
of the country may be fully grasped; and
the same is true of those parts of the article
which deal with agriculture and with
the commerce of which the first developments
were associated with early exploration.
There is ample and authoritative
information on all these subjects in the
article, which is equivalent in length to
85 pages of this Guide. The sections and
their contributors are: <i>Geography</i>, by
Prof. A. P. Coleman, Toronto University;
<i>Population</i>, <i>Commerce</i>, etc., by Prof. W.
L. Grant, Queens University, Kingston;

with the summary view in the
article <span class='sc'>British Empire</span> (Vol. 4, p. 606),
equivalent to 30 pages of this Guide, by
Lady Lugard, wife of the British explorer
and colonial administrator, Sir Frederick
Lugard, herself an authority on colonial
subjects and well-known as colonial
editor of the <i>Times</i> of London. On pp.
608–610 there is a chronological list of
the acquisitions of the Empire, and nothing
will surprise the reader more than
the comparative recentness of the movement
by which two small islands have
expanded into an empire covering nearly
one-fourth of the earth’s land surface.
Except for the Channel Islands, the
Isle of Man, and “the nominal possession
of Newfoundland by Sir Humphrey
Gilbert in 1583, all the territorial acquisitions
of the Empire have been made
in the 17th and subsequent centuries.”
On each of the localities mentioned in
this imposing list the reader will find
a separate article in its proper alphabetical
place in the Encyclopaedia Britannica
dealing with geography, government
and history. Here it will be
possible only to call attention to articles
on the more important branches of the
subject.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLVII<br> <span class='c014'>THE FAR EAST</span></h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Asiatic Characteristics</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>An account, in this chapter, of the
principal articles dealing with the
history of India, China and Japan,
will sufficiently indicate to the student
the plan adopted in the Britannica’s
treatment of all the countries in the far
East. But before turning to these three
groups of articles, he should read <span class='sc'>Asia</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 734), which defines the social
and economic position of the Orient in
general, and gives a survey of the field
covered by articles on Eastern countries
other than the three dealt with in this
chapter. This article, equivalent in
length to 65 pages of this Guide, is by Sir
Richard Strachey, the famous Indian
administrator; Sir Charles Eliot, of the
British diplomatic service Sir T. H.
Holdich, of the Indian Frontier Survey;
and Philip Lake, the Oriental geologist.
The general survey
of Asiatic characteristics,
as revealed by
history, with which
the historical section (p. 749) of the article
begins, is noteworthy in connection
with current political questions:</p>

<p class='c020'>The words “Asiatic” and “oriental” are
often used as if they denoted a definite and
homogeneous type, but Russians resemble
Asiatics in many ways, and Turks, Hindus,
Chinese, etc., differ in so many important
points that the common substratum is small.
It amounts to this, that Asiatics have not
the same sentiment of independence and
freedom as Europeans. Individuals are
thought of as members of a family, state or
religion, rather than as entities with a destiny
and rights of their own. This leads to
autocracy in politics, fatalism in religion,
and conservatism in both.</p>

<p class='c007'>All three of these are certainly conspicuous
in the history of the first Eastern
country dealt with in this chapter.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>INDIA</h4>

<p class='c017'>In the article <span class='sc'>India</span> (Vol. 14, p. 375),
(equivalent to 140 pages of this Guide)
there is much of value to the historical
student besides the chapter on <i>History</i>
(p. 395), which is written by Sir William
Wilson Hunter, administrative head of
the statistical survey of India and one of
the editors of <i>The Imperial Gazetteer of
India</i>, and by James Sutherland Cotton,
editor of this same Gazetteer. Particularly
important are the sections, <i>The
People</i> (p. 382), <i>Administration</i> (p. 385),
and <i>Indian Costume</i> (p. 417), illustrated
from pen-and-ink drawings by J. Lockwood
Kipling, known to many as the
illustrator of his son’s book <i>Kim</i>. And
the student of Oriental history will find
it possible to gain a little comprehension—at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>least—of Oriental ways of thought,
Eastern setting and colour, by reading in
the Britannica such articles as <span class='sc'>Caste</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 464), <span class='sc'>Hinduism</span> (Vol. 13, p.
501), <span class='sc'>Brahmanism</span>, <span class='sc'>Brahman</span> and <span class='sc'>Brahmana</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 378), all by Prof. Julius
Eggeling, Edinburgh; <span class='sc'>Buddha</span> and <span class='sc'>Buddhism</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 737), both by Prof. T.
W. Rhys Davids of Manchester, author
of <i>Sacred Books of the Buddhas</i>, etc.;
<span class='sc'>Mahomet</span> (Vol. 17, p. 399), by Prof. D.
G. Margoliouth, Oxford; <span class='sc'>Mahommedan
Institutions</span> and <span class='sc'>Mahommedan Law</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 411), by Prof. D. S. Macdonald,
Hartford Theological Seminary,
and <span class='sc'>Mahommedan Religion</span> (Vol. 17, p.
417), by Rev. G. W. Thatcher, Camden
College, Sydney, N. S. W.; <span class='sc'>Indian Law</span>
(Vol. 14, p. 434), by Sir William Markby,
author of <i>Lectures on English Law</i>, etc.;
and <span class='sc'>Zoroaster</span> (Vol. 28, p. 1039), by
Prof. Karl Geldner, Marburg, and <span class='sc'>Parsees</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 866). This list of articles
subsidiary to the history of India
could be prolonged almost indefinitely,
but enough has been given to put the
student on the track of valuable articles
which might otherwise escape his notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we come to the authentic history
of India there is a legendary period,
the only historic test for which is the rock
inscriptions,—see the article <span class='sc'>Inscriptions</span>,
<i>Indian</i> (Vol. 14, p. 621), by J. F.
Fleet, author of <i>Inscriptions of the Early
Gupta Kings</i>. On the earliest literary description
of the Aryans in India and their
contests with the Dravidians see the article
<span class='sc'>Sanskrit</span>, <i>Vedic Period</i> (especially
p. 161 of Vol. 24, on the <i>Rig Veda</i>)—and
in general the articles <span class='sc'>Aryan</span> and <span class='sc'>Dravidian</span>.
An interesting reconstruction of
the civilization of the primitive Aryans
on the basis of languages will be found in
the article <span class='sc'>Indo-European Languages</span>
(Vol. 14, especially pp. 498–500), by Dr.
Peter Giles, Cambridge, author of <i>Manual
of Comparative Philology</i>; and this picture
of Aryan life before the conquest of India
will hold in the main for the earlier period
of the Aryans in India.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Early Buddhism</div>

<p class='c007'>With the 6th century we come to the
beginning of the Buddhist period. See
the article <span class='sc'>Jains</span>, the articles on Buddhism
already mentioned,
and the articles:
<span class='sc'>Asoka</span>, the
great Buddhist emperor
and organizer of the faith, whose
rock inscriptions throughout India are so
valuable as historical records; <span class='sc'>Kanishka</span>,
the Buddhist king of Kabul and Kashmir;
<span class='sc'>Fa-Hien</span> and <span class='sc'>Hsüan Tsang</span>, the Chinese
pilgrims of India, who left important
records of early Buddhism and of Brahmanism,
which was steadily growing in
power and strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hindu period, overlapping the
Buddhist, is marked by the beginning of
Western influences on India. For the
Persians in India see the articles <span class='sc'>Persia</span>
(Vol. 21, especially pp. 209–210), <span class='sc'>Darius</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 832), and <span class='sc'>Scylax</span>, the Greek
who under Darius’s orders explored the
course of the Indus. Far more important
was the conquest by Alexander the Great
and the establishment of the Hellenistic
empire of the Seleucids in Syria, Bactria
and India: see <span class='sc'>Alexander the Great</span>
(Vol. 1, especially p. 548), <span class='sc'>Nearchus</span>,
Alexander’s admiral and navigator, and
<span class='sc'>Seleucid Dynasty</span>. The first paramount
ruler of India was <span class='sc'>Chandragupta</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 839), whom the Greeks called
Sandracottus and who crushed the Seleucid
power and founded the Maurya dynasty.
Of his grandson Asoka we have
already spoken in outlining the growth
and decline of Buddhism. In this period
Greek thought and art influenced India
greatly, and in the period immediately
following—2nd century B.C.—northwestern
India was invaded again by western
troops: see <span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>, <span class='sc'>Eucratides</span>,
<span class='sc'>Menander</span>. The records of the next four
centuries are confused and vague; on the
invasions from the North, see <span class='sc'>Saka</span> and
<span class='sc'>Yue-Chi</span>, by Sir Charles Norton Edgcumbe
Eliot.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Yue-Chi founded the Kushan dynasty,
in which the greatest king was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span><span class='sc'>Kanishka</span> (Vol. 15, p. 653), already mentioned
as a Buddhist ruler whose policy
marked the beginning of the end of Buddhism
in India. On the succeeding dynasty
see the article <span class='sc'>Gupta</span>; and refer
again to the article <span class='sc'>Fa-Hien</span> for the Chinese
account of the rule of the second
Gupta king, Chandragupta,—on whom in
legend see <span class='sc'>Vikramaditya</span>. On the White
Huns and their invasion consult the articles
<span class='sc'>Ephthalites</span> and <span class='sc'>Huns</span>. On the
only other great king of this period, who
was paramount monarch of northern India
in the first half of the 7th century and
whose administration was described by
Hsüan-Tsang, see <span class='sc'>Harsha</span>. On the principal
Deccan dynasties of the Hindu period,
see <span class='sc'>Chalukya</span> and <span class='sc'>Rashtrakuta</span>,
and the article <span class='sc'>Deccan</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mahommedans and Moslems</div>

<p class='c007'>For a general notion of the Mahommedan
period in India the student should
read the articles on Mahommedanism already
mentioned,
and for more definite
information about
India, the articles
on the 11th century invader <span class='sc'>Mahmud of
Ghazni</span> (Vol. 17, p. 397), and on <span class='sc'>Somnath</span>,
the temple city which he captured and
sacked in 1025. See <span class='sc'>Deccan</span> and <span class='sc'>Gujarat</span>
for the Moslem conquest of these
states by Ala-ud-din. For the destruction
of the Tughlak dynasty, which followed
Ala-ud-din’s successors, see <span class='sc'>Afghanistan</span>
(Vol. 1, especially p. 315) and
<span class='sc'>Timur</span> (Vol. 26, p. 994), by Major-General
Sir Frederick John Goldsmid. The
“last stand made by the national faith in
India against conquering Islam” was in
<span class='sc'>Vijayanagar</span> (Vol. 28, p. 62). With the
16th century and the Mogul dynasty, India
is quite definitely Moslem: see <span class='sc'>Baber</span>,
<span class='sc'>Humayun</span>, <span class='sc'>Akbar</span>, <span class='sc'>Abul Fazl</span> the historian
of Akbar’s reign, <span class='sc'>Jahangir</span>, <span class='sc'>Shah
Jahan</span>, and <span class='sc'>Agra</span> and <span class='sc'>Indian Architecture</span>
(especially Fig. 17, opposite p. 433,
Vol. 14) for the Taj Mahal, the Mausoleum
built by Shah Jahan for his wife
Mumtäz Mal, and—for the culmination
of the Mogul power, the beginning of its
decay, and the first sign of Moslem bigotry
and intolerance on the part of the
Mogul emperors,—<span class='sc'>Aurangzeb</span>. His attempt
to conquer the Mahommedan
kings of the Deccan gave the natives an
opportunity to regain power: see the article
<span class='sc'>Mahrattas</span>, and for the earlier risings
of the Mahrattas, <span class='sc'>Sivaji</span>. And for
the rise of Afghan power under the
Durani dynasty and the battle of Panipat
in 1761, a crushing defeat for the Mahrattas,

<h4 class='c016'>CHINA</h4>

<p class='c017'>As with India, so with China, the whole
of the article in the Britannica is of value
to the historical student. The article
<span class='sc'>China</span> (Vol. 6, pp. 166–231) is equivalent
to 200 pages of this Guide. The most
important part for the student of history
is section V. (pp. 188–212) on <i>History</i>:
but such parts of the article as <i>Geography</i>,
with a coloured map, the <i>People</i> (pp. 171–174),
<i>Religion</i> (174–177), <i>Economics</i> (177–181),
<i>Government and Administration</i>
(181–188), <i>Art</i> (213–216) with illustrations,
and <i>Language and Literature</i> (216–231)
are all of importance to help get the
background that is so baffling to an occidental
studying the Far East. As was the
case with India, the study of religions is
particularly important and besides the
section <i>Religion</i> in the article <span class='sc'>China</span>, the
student should turn to the articles <span class='sc'>Lao-Tsze</span>,
the founder of a philosophy debased
into Taoism, <span class='sc'>Mencius</span>, and <span class='sc'>Confucius</span>,
all by the Rev. James Legge, author of
<i>The Religions of China</i>, and the editor of
<i>The Chinese Classics</i>, and <span class='sc'>Buddhism</span> and
<span class='sc'>Lamaism</span>, the latter the form of Buddhism
in vogue in China,—and he should
remember that there are some Mahommedans
in China. In connection with the
latest developments in Chinese history
he should read with great care in the article
<span class='sc'>China</span>, Section IV, <i>Government and
Administration</i>, especially p. 184 on the
Civil Service, an elaborate merit system.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section V. of the article <span class='sc'>China</span> opens
with a treatment by Sir Henry Yule, the
famous Orientalist, of the European
knowledge of China before 1615, particularly
“Cathay” and the early explorers
of Mongolia, <span class='sc'>Carpini</span> (see Vol. 5, p.
397) and <span class='sc'>Rubruquis</span> (see Vol. 23, pp.
810–812), and of Cathay itself <span class='sc'>Marco
Polo</span> (see Vol. 22, pp. 7–10). The internal
history of China begins (Vol. 6, p.
191) with a discussion of Chinese origins:
“anthropological arguments seem to contradict
the idea of any connection with
Babylonians, Egyptians, Assyrians, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Indians. The earliest hieroglyphics of
the Chinese, ascribed by them to the
Shang dynasty (second millenium B.C.)
betray the Mongol character of the nation
that invented them by the decided obliquity
of the human eye whenever it appears
in an ideograph.... Our standpoint
as regards the origin of the Chinese
race is, therefore, that of the agnostic....
Their civilization was already old at a
time when Britain and Germany were
peopled by half-naked barbarians, and
the philosophical and ethical principles
on which it is based remain, to all appearances,
as firmly rooted as ever.” Chinese
legendary history goes back to Fu-hi as
the “first historical emperor; and they
place his lifetime in the years 2852–2738
B.C.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The First
Definite Date<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
There is much that is purely legendary
and mythical in these early records,
but with the
year 776 B.C. we
find a veritable record:
in an ode referring
to a wicked emperor there is mention
of “certain signs showing that Heaven itself
is indignant at Yu-wang’s crimes.
One of these signs was an eclipse of the
sun&#160;... the date and month being
clearly stated. This date corresponds
exactly with August 29, 776 B.C.; and
astronomers have calculated that on that
precise date an eclipse of the sun was
visible in North China.” It is an interesting
coincidence that this earliest sure
date in Chinese history is the date of the
first Greek Olympiad, from which time
was reckoned in the Greek calendar—though
there are no certain dates in
Greek history until much later. The first
outstanding event in the history of China
was nearly 20 centuries later—the Mongol
invasion; see the articles <span class='sc'>Mongols</span>
(Vol. 18, pp. 712–719) and <span class='sc'>Jenghiz Khan</span>
(Vol. 15, p. 316), both by Sir Robert K.
Douglas, author of <i>The Life of Jenghiz
Khan</i>. On the period immediately following
see <span class='sc'>Kublai Khan</span>, for the foundation
of the Mongol dynasty, and the section
<i>Medieval Cathay</i> (Vol. 6, p. 189) of
the article <span class='sc'>China</span> for early exploration
and missionary effort. Mongol rule was
broken in the 14th century by the founder
of the Ming dynasty. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Foreign
Relations<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Portuguese
arrival at Canton in 1517 marked the
beginning of modern intercourse with
Europe; and see the article <span class='sc'>Matteo Ricci</span>
by Sir Henry Yule, for the first important
work of a Christian
missionary in China
early in the 17th century.
Immediately
thereafter came the Manchu invasion, on
which see the article <span class='sc'>Manchuria</span>, by Sir
R. K. Douglas. Trade with Europe on
a large scale began in the second half of
the 18th century; see the article <span class='sc'>Canton</span>.
British diplomatic missions for the improvement
of the condition of traders in
Canton were unsuccessful, but in 1840
the opium war made China feel the weight
of Great Britain’s power when Hong
Kong was ceded to the English and other
ports were opened to trade: see <span class='sc'>Lord
Napier</span>, <span class='sc'>Sir Hugh Gough</span>, and <span class='sc'>Hong-Kong</span>.

of Great Britain with China, see <span class='sc'>Sir

disputes of 1858 and 1860 see <span class='sc'>Amur</span> and
<span class='sc'>Vladivostok</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of China since 1875 is told
pretty completely in the article <span class='sc'>China</span>,
in two sections, the first on 1875–1901
being by Sir Valentine Chirol, author
of <i>The Far Eastern Question</i>. But
in connection with the general treatment
the student should read the articles on
<span class='sc'>Korea</span>, <span class='sc'>Annam</span> and <span class='sc'>Tongking</span> for the earlier
efforts to detach from the Chinese
empire these quasi-vassals; <span class='sc'>Chino-Japanese

<h4 class='c016'>JAPAN</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Japanese in America</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Japan</span> (Vol. 15, p. 156) is
equivalent to 370 pages of this Guide,—and
is almost entirely the work of Captain
Frank Brinkley, editor of the <i>Japan
Mail</i>, author of <i>Japan</i>, <i>A History of
Japan</i>, <i>An Unabridged Japanese-English
Dictionary</i>, etc. The article is divided
into 10 parts—<i>Geography</i>, <i>People</i>, <i>Language
and Literature</i>, <i>Art</i>, <i>Economic Conditions</i>,
<i>Government and Administration</i>,
<i>Religion</i>, <i>Foreign Intercourse</i>, <i>Domestic
History</i>, and <i>The Claim of Japan; A Japanese
View</i>, by Baron Dairoku Kikuchi, in
which the president of the Imperial University
of Kyoto and of the Imperial
Academy of Japan discusses “the ambition
of the Japanese people&#160;... to be
recognized as an equal by the Great
Powers,” their resenting “any discrimination
against them as an Asiatic people,”
the “misrepresentation, arising from want
of proper knowledge of Japanese character
and feelings,”
that the Japanese
immediately after
the war with Russia
were “ready and eager to fight with the
United States”—whereas the Japanese
have always regarded the Americans
with a special good will, due no doubt to
the steady liberal attitude of the American
government and people towards
Japan and Japanese, and they look upon
the idea of war between Japan and the
United States as ridiculous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Marks of the Race</div>

<p class='c007'>Any justifiable discrimination against
the Japanese as Asiatics must of course be
based upon such characteristics of custom
and thought as render Japanese immigration
undesirable, and not upon the
colour of the Japanese skin or any other
peculiarity of appearance. But it is none
the less interesting to turn from Baron
Dairoku Kikuchi’s argument to Capt.
Brinkley’s careful study (p. 164) of the
physical characteristics of the Japanese.
“The best authorities are agreed that the
Japanese do not differ, physically, from
their Korean and Chinese neighbors as
much as the inhabitants of Northern
Europe differ from those of Southern
Europe.” Some of the bodily traits
which distinguish the Japanese from
races of European origin are to be observed
“in the eyes, the eyelashes, the
cheekbones and the beard.”
The eyeball does not differ
from that of an occidental,
but the eye is less deeply
set. The conspicuous peculiarity is that
the upper eyelids are much heavier at the
inner corners than at the outer, making
the eyes apparently oblique; and a fold
of the upper lids hangs over the roots of
the upper lashes. The lashes, too, are
short and scanty, and converge, instead
of diverging as they do in occidentals, so
that the tips are nearer together than the
roots. There is but little hair on the
face (except among the Ainus), and it is
nearly always straight. The cheekbones
are prominent among the lower, rather
than the upper classes. The article proceeds
to discuss the moral characteristics
of the Japanese; attributing to them a
degree of frugality and endurance such
as to make it virtually impossible for any
occidental race, living in reasonable comfort,
to compete with Japanese labour.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in the study of India and China, it
will be well for the student of Japanese
history to make himself familiar with the
Britannica’s full material on native religion:
see Vol. 15, p. 222, noting especially
that in the section on Shinto it is
said: “The grandson of the sun goddess
was the first sovereign of Japan, and his
descendants have ruled the land in unbroken
succession ever since.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Foreign intercourse</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>In Japanese history two main topics of
study present themselves—foreign intercourse
and domestic or internal history—the
former naturally the more attractive
to the foreign student,
and of additional interest
both because of its
picturesque and romantic
early detail and by reason of its explaining
the sudden emergence of Japan
as a power in world politics. Portuguese
shipwrecked in Japan in 1542 or
1543 opened the country to Portuguese
trade and in 1549 landed the great Jesuit
missionary, <span class='sc'>Francisco de Xavier</span>: see
the article by K. G. Jayne, author of
<i>Vasco da Gama and his Successors</i>. The
contest between Spain and Portugal for
Eastern trade and between Jesuits and
Franciscans for Japanese converts to
Christianity and the other factors that
resulted in the suppression of Christianity
in 1614 and the consequent persecutions
of converts and missionaries are told in
the article <span class='sc'>Japan</span>—and so also is the
story of the foothold that Dutch and
English traders got before the Japanese
practically excluded them also, as Christians
rather than as foreigners or traders.
From the middle of the 17th to the beginning
of the 19th century Japan was practically
untouched by Western civilization.
The part of the United States navy
in opening the country to trade in 1853
is described in the article <span class='sc'>Japan</span> (pp. 237–238)
and in the article <span class='sc'>Matthew Calbraith
Perry</span>. The article <span class='sc'>Japan</span> also
devotes much space (p. 238) to the work
done by another American, Townsend
Harris, who was less known than Perry,
but who carried through the immensely
important first commercial treaty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Recent Wars</div>

<p class='c007'>The remainder of the story of Japan’s
foreign relations is given in the main article
<span class='sc'>Japan</span>, but the
student should read
besides the articles
<span class='sc'>Chino-Japanese War</span>, <span class='sc'>Manchuria</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Russo-Japanese War</span>. The last of
these would be equivalent to 40 pages of
this Guide; it is accompanied by the following
plans: <i>General Dispositions after
Nanshan</i>, <i>Liao-Yang</i>, <i>Port Arthur</i>, and
<i>Mukden</i>: and it is a remarkable critical
summary of the military operations of
the war. Read also the biographies of
<span class='sc'>Katsura</span>, <span class='sc'>Kodama</span>, <span class='sc'>Kuroki</span>, <span class='sc'>Nogi</span>,
<span class='sc'>Nozu</span>, <span class='sc'>Okuma</span>, <span class='sc'>Oyama</span>, <span class='sc'>Togo</span>, <span class='sc'>Yamagata</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Domestic History</div>

<p class='c007'>As for domestic history, it is important
to note that early Japanese history is
more purely mythical and legendary, and
is chronologically untrustworthy
for a longer period
than is Chinese history.
The conventionally
accepted date of the establishment
of the Empire is 660 B. C.; and from
this year all dates are reckoned; but
Japanese annals are self-contradictory
and are proved faulty by Chinese and
Korean records. Even the famed Japanese
invasion of Korea in 200 is possibly
apocryphal, and there are few trustworthy
recorded facts before 400 A.D. or
dates before 500 A.D. In the middle of
the 6th century Chinese influence, through
Korea, became strong, and in 552 Buddhism
was introduced from Korea. A
century later legislative government and
administrative reform began.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Japanese feudal system beginning
in the 12th century see: the article
<span class='sc'>Bushido</span>; in the article <span class='sc'>Japan</span> the account
of the earlier army; and the articles
<span class='sc'>Shogun</span> and <span class='sc'>Mikado</span>. The more important

<p class='c007'>For the chief branches of economic
theory read:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Economic Theory</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Value</span> (Vol. 27, p. 867) by Dr. J. S.
Nicholson, professor of political economy,
Edinburgh University, author of <i>Principles
of Political
Economy</i>, etc. This
article, equivalent to
25 pages of this
Guide, distinguishes between utility and
value—to be valuable a “thing must
have some utility; and there must be some
difficulty in its attainment.” There are
three laws of value—supply and demand,
in the discussion of which monopoly-values
and competition-values are considered;
that of cost of production, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>cost of raw material and wages are
obvious factors; and that of increasing
cost with increased quantity of production,—upon
which depends the theory of
rent.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Wealth</span> (Vol. 28, p. 437) is by the
same author, who adopts the definition
of wealth connected with the name of
Adolf von Held, based on a study of
<i>consumption</i>, <i>production</i> and <i>distribution</i>
of wealth,—“consumable utilities which
require labour for their production
and can be appropriated and exchanged.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Consumption</span> (Vol. 7, p. 23) is the
“destruction of utilities.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Production</span> (Vol. 22, p. 423) is the
creation of utilities.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Capital</span> (Vol. 5, p. 278) is accumulated
wealth available for earning interest
and producing fresh wealth. “It
is not antithetical to labour, but&#160;... the
accumulated savings of labour and of
the profits accruing from the savings of
labour.” The “importance of ability
or brain-work, as against much of modern
theorizing against capitalism,” must
not be overlooked.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Wages</span> (Vol. 28, p. 229), also by Dr.
Nicholson, is equivalent to 17 pages in
this Guide. It distinguishes between
nominal and real wages, describes the
economic wages fund theory, and deals
with such topics as state regulation of
wages, factory legislation, trades unions
and wages, effects of machinery on
wages.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Tariffs, Trusts, etc.</div>

<p class='c007'>Among the more interesting general

matters of constant and great importance
both in politics and
business. See the

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Trusts</span> (Vol. 27, p. 334), by
Prof. J. W. Jenks of New York University
should be supplemented by the article
<span class='sc'>Gilds</span> (Vol. 12, p. 14), contributed

pages 725–726, 729, 734. See also
under separate state headings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Labour and Wages</div>

<p class='c007'>The article on Gilds just referred to
will serve as an introduction to the
subject of labour and labour organizations.
The most important
articles on
modern conditions
are <span class='sc'>Trade Unions</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 140); <span class='sc'>Strikes and Lockouts</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 1024); and <span class='sc'>Labour
Legislation</span> (Vol. 16, p. 7), all with
American sections by Carroll D. Wright,
late U. S. Commissioner of Labor. On
labour legislation see the special article
<span class='sc'>Employers’ Liability</span> (Vol. 9, p. 356)
and the sections on legislation and miscellaneous
laws in separate state articles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Statistics, Population, etc.</div>

<p class='c007'>One of the great branches of economics
is the study of statistics. Advisedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>we say “<i>study</i> of statistics” and in the
Britannica the student
will find comparatively
few statistical
tables, but
much analysis both of statistics
and of their meaning. For statistics of
population see, for instance, the section
on population in the article <span class='sc'>United
States</span> or in any one of the state or city
articles. Under <i>Population and Social
Conditions</i> in the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>
(Vol. 27, pp. 634–638) are treated:
growth of the nation geographically and
in population, with special consideration
of immigration; changes in localities;
urban and rural population; interstate
migration; sexes; vital statistics—death
rate, marriage, families, birth-rate, illiteracy;
religious statistics; occupations;
national wealth. And the state articles
give: total population at each census;
foreign-born and of foreign parentage,—often
with analysis and historical outlines
of immigration and its variation
and character and amount; religious statistics;
negroes and whites, Indians, Asiatics,
etc.; urban population, with list of
larger cities and population of each. In
articles on American cities and towns
population figures are given from the
last census; comparisons are made between
native and foreign-born and the
foreign-born are classified, and, where
there is a predominant element, like
the Germans in Cincinnati and St. Louis,
an estimate of the influence of this
element.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the problems of population
peculiar to the United States, particularly
the Southern states, is the negro.
See the article <span class='sc'>Negro</span> (Vol. 19, p. 344),
especially the part dealing with the
United States, which is by Walter F.
Willcox, professor of social science and
statistics in Cornell University and chief
statistician of the U. S. Census Bureau.
This article and that on <span class='sc'>Divorce</span> (Vol. 8,
p. 334)—another urgent American problem—are
remarkable examples of the
treatment of a social question from the
point of view of a statistician in a most
interesting and illuminating manner,
although based on dry statistics, and
in a manner all the more satisfying and
accurate because it has carefully
analyzed figures at the back of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The status of the negro in different
states is described in the separate state
articles, and there, too, the reader will
find a summary of local divorce laws.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other articles coming under the head
of population are <span class='sc'>Infanticide</span>, <span class='sc'>Illegitimacy</span>,
<span class='sc'>Legitimacy</span> and <span class='sc'>Legitimation</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Social Legislation</div>

<p class='c007'>In the chapter in this Guide on <i>Questions
of the Day</i> attention is called to the
increasing tendency of the state to
control and regulate
matters which a generation
or so ago
were considered outside
the sphere of government. Two
particular economic questions—“social
evils” we sometimes call them—are foremost
in this category and on these the
student of economics should read in
the Britannica:</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Prostitution</span> (Vol. 22, p.
457), by Dr. Arthur Shadwell, member
of the Council of the Epidemiological
Society and author of <i>Industrial Efficiency
and Drink</i>, <i>Temperance and Legislation</i>,
and the articles <span class='sc'>Liquor Laws</span> (Vol.
16, p. 759) and <span class='sc'>Temperance</span> (Vol. 26,
p. 578), also by Dr. Shadwell. These
should be supplemented by accounts of
local legislation against liquor, as for
example in the articles <span class='sc'>Maine</span>, <span class='sc'>Kansas</span>,
<span class='sc'>South Carolina</span>, etc. On the Gothenburg
system of Sweden and Norway see
Vol. 16, pp. 769 and 780, and Vol. 26,
p. 587, where, we learn that the essence
of this method of conducting the retail
traffic is that the element of private
gain is eliminated. See besides biographies
of temperance reformers—e.g.,
<span class='sc'>Theobald Mathew</span>, <span class='sc'>Neal Dow</span>, <span class='sc'>John
B. Gough</span>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another great problem which the state
and the municipality are attempting to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>solve, or to help solve, by means of
legislation is that of housing. See the
article <span class='sc'>Housing</span> (Vol. 13, p. 814), which
comprises not only the topic of city housing
and its faults due to overcrowding,
excessive value of land in great cities,
etc., but the subject of rural housing,
and the experiments in garden cities,
model towns, etc. See also the article
<span class='sc'>Octavia Hill</span> (Vol. 13, p. 465), and for
American model towns, <span class='sc'>Hopedale</span>, <span class='sc'>Pullman</span>,
etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Social Welfare</div>

<p class='c007'>Many movements for social welfare
are of a very different character and are
based on an entirely different principle
from that of repressive
or controlling
legislation. Charities,
education, care of insane, training
of defectives, prison reform—such are a
few of these topics, and the student will
quickly learn that these burdens have
been borne quite as much by the individual
as by the State, and that in many
instances individual initiative has by
long and laborious effort succeeded in
reforming in this field abuses which had
flourished under government care.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Charity</div>

<p class='c007'>Of prime importance to the student
is the elaborate article on <span class='sc'>Charity and
Charities</span> (Vol. 5, p. 860), by Dr.
Charles Stewart Loch, secretary
to the council of
the London Charity Organization
Society and author of <i>Charity
Organization</i>, <i>Methods of Social Advance</i>,
etc. This article, equivalent in contents
to 100 pages of this Guide, is made up
of an introduction and six parts, as
follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Introduction: “Charity,” as used in
New Testament, means love and mercy—an
ideal social state.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part I.—Primitive Charity—highly developed
idea of duty to guest or stranger,
whether beggar or vagrant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part II.—Charity among the Greeks.
“In Crete and Sparta the citizens were
wholly supported out of the public resources.”
In Athens, charity by: legal
enactment for release of debts; assisted
emigration; gifts of grain; poor relief for
infirm and for orphans of soldiers; pay
for public service; private charity; loan
societies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part III.—Charity in Roman Times.
“The system obliged the hard-working to
maintain the idlers, while it continually
increased their number.” “The effect on
agriculture, and proportionally on commerce
generally, was ruinous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Part IV.—Jewish and Christian Charity.
In Christianity a fusion of Jewish
and Greco-Roman practice. Summary of
Hebrew Charity. “To mark the line of
development, we compare: 1. The family
among Jews and in the early Christian
church. 2. The sources of relief and the
tithe, the treatment of the poor and their
aid, and the assistance of special classes
of poor. 3. The care of strangers; and,
lastly, we would consider the theory of
alms giving, friendship or love, and charity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Part V.—Medieval Charity and its Development.
St. Francis and his influence.
St. Thomas Aquinas. Medieval endowed
charities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Part VI.—After the Reformation.
“The religious life was to be democratic—not
in religious bodies, but in the whole
people; and in a new sense—in relation
to family and social life—it was to be
moral. That was the significance of the
Reformation.” Organization of municipal
relief. Poor relief acts and statutory serfdom.
Progress of thought in 18th and
19th century: influence of Rousseau, of
Law, of Howard, of Bentham, of Nonconformists,
particularly Friends in England;
Society for Bettering the Condition
of the Poor (1796). The Poor Law.
Movement for Old Age Pensions. Charity
Organization. Hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>American charities and their peculiar
problems.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other articles bearing on the subject
are:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Poor Law</span> (Vol. 22, p. 74), for the
British system, and Dr. T. A. Ingram’s
articles <span class='sc'>Unemployment</span> (Vol. 27, p. 578)
and <span class='sc'>Vagrancy</span> (Vol. 27, p. 837).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Prisons</div>

<p class='c007'>One of the earliest and most important
definite charitable movements was prison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>reform. On this subject see in the
Britannica the articles,—all
by Major Arthur Griffiths,
British inspector of
prisons,—<span class='sc'>Prison</span>, <span class='sc'>Crime</span>, <span class='sc'>Criminology</span>,
<span class='sc'>Children’s Courts</span>, <span class='sc'>Police</span>, <span class='sc'>Juvenile
Offenders</span>, <span class='sc'>Deportation</span>, <span class='sc'>Finger
Prints</span>, <span class='sc'>Identification</span>. This series of
articles shows both the improvements
in methods of treating criminals, in itself
a means of protecting society, and
the better methods of defense and of
police.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Insane</div>

<p class='c007'>On the treatment of the insane and
feeble-minded, on the gradual assumption
of responsibility for them by governments,
and on the transition
from the prison-like
asylum to the modern hospital,
see the article <span class='sc'>Insanity</span>, particularly
part III (Vol. 14, p. 616), on Hospital
Treatment, by Dr. Frederick Peterson,
professor of psychiatry, Columbia
University, author of <i>Mental Diseases</i>,
etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Deaf and Blind</div>

<p class='c007'>As great as the change in treatment
of the insane has been that in the treatment
of the deaf and blind. On this
subject read the
articles; <span class='sc'>Blindness</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 59), by
Sir Francis J. Campbell, principal of the
Royal Normal College for the Blind;
and <span class='sc'>Deaf and Dumb</span> (Vol. 7, p. 880), by
the Rev. Arnold Hill Payne, chaplain of
the Oxford Diocesan Mission to the
Deaf and Dumb. Both these authors
have had experience in teaching in the
United States as well as in Great Britain,—one
of the many striking instances of
the wisdom displayed in the choice of
contributors to the Britannica. And see
the articles on <span class='sc'>Gallaudet</span> (Vol. 11, p.
416), the great teacher of the deaf, and
<span class='sc'>S. G. Howe</span> (Vol. 13, p. 837), the educator
of the blind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Biographies</div>

<p class='c007'>The following list, arranged for the
most part in chronological order, gives
some of the names of reformers and
philanthropists
about whom there
are separate articles.
These biographical sketches will be of
great value for the study of the history
and development of charitable work for
the public welfare.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLIX<br> <span class='c014'>HEALTH AND DISEASE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>You may have happened to glance
at one of the text-books written
for the use of medical students
and of doctors, and found that you could
hardly understand a word of it. And yet
you have found, when you consulted a
specialist, and he wanted to explain to
you just what was wrong with some part
of your body, that he could make it all
quite clear to you. The six hundred articles
on health and disease in the Britannica
are written by specialists, most
of them, indeed, by professors in the
leading medical schools; and these contributors
to the Britannica are also the
authors of many of the best text-books
that practising physicians and surgeons
habitually use. But in the Britannica
the specialists were writing for the general
public; and for that reason they have
taken care not to be too technical either
in their point of view or in the language
they use.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Right and Wrong Way to Read</div>

<p class='c007'>In this present chapter of the Reader’s
Guide, the subject of health and disease
is treated just as the Guide treats any
other department of
knowledge. You may
want to learn something
about it because
it is one of the
most wonderful branches of science, just
as you would take up the course of reading
on astronomy. Or you may feel that
you ought to know more than you do
about your own body, about the way you
should live in order to preserve your
health, and about the causes of the diseases
to which you are exposed. Some
people will tell you that it is unwise to
read about the subject at all. That is
absurd. There are no doubt exceptional
people, with unsound nerves, who will
imagine they must take every patent
medicine they see advertised, and who
long to try every newly discovered serum
that the newspapers tell them about.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Danger of “Doctoring” Yourself</div>

<p class='c007'>Again, you may be told that if you try
to learn something about health and disease,
you will be tempted to think you
know as much as the
doctor; and so neglect
to go to him
when you need his
advice. But this objection,
again, applies only to people who
lack good sense. For example, if you read
the article on <span class='sc'>Dentistry</span>, by Dr. E. C.
Kirk, dean of the Dental Faculty of the
University of Pennsylvania, it will help
you to understand whatever your dentist
may be doing for you. But it will certainly
not give you the idea that you
could fill your own teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>When you find your watch has stopped,
you wind it. Then, if it does not start,
you take it to the watchmaker. If, instead
of doing that, you tried to tinker
with it yourself, you would soon be in
trouble. On the other hand, it would be
ridiculous to go to the watchmaker without
first finding out whether the watch
merely wanted winding, and a man ought
to know enough about his watch to connect
the fact that it has stopped with the
probability that he has forgotten to wind
it. The daily winding is his work, not the
watchmaker’s. The chemical and mechanical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>work that is going on within
you is as complicated as anything
in a watch or anything that you
could see in a laboratory or factory.
It is your business (<i>and your most important
business, for if you neglect it, you
will not be able to do anything properly,
for yourself or for anybody else</i>) to keep
this machinery running, and to do that
is not so simple as to wind a watch. Your
body needs food and warmth. It very
probably gets too much of both. Furthermore,
the food is often unwholesome,
and the warmed air is often bad air. But
unless you are a millionaire invalid, you
do not have a private doctor with you at
all hours to watch the food put on your
plate and to ventilate your room.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Kind of Knowledge You Need</div>

<p class='c007'>The average watch is better treated
than the average human body, and when
the average body goes wrong, through the
average man’s
thoughtlessness, he
proceeds, without in
the least knowing
what is wrong, to
take violent medicines, or to experiment
with some fad about diet or underclothing
or gymnastics, and to make matters very
much worse. The knowledge he can gain
from the Britannica will tend to keep him
from being careless, and also from trying
to doctor himself when he needs professional
care. Whether you undertake a
complete course of medical reading or
not, it is certainly worth your while to
read the first group of articles mentioned
in this chapter—those which have to do
with the healthy routine of life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Eating and Drinking</div>

<p class='c007'>You will find the best introduction to
the subject of diet in general in a section
(Vol. 26, p. 799) of the article <span class='sc'>Therapeutics</span>,
by Sir Lauder
Brunton. He is
one of the most famous
consulting physicians
in the world, and he gives you advice
which your own doctor will certainly
confirm when he tells you that the way
to avoid indigestion is to masticate your
food well and sip half a pint of hot water
four times a day—when you go to bed,
when you get up, and again about an
hour before luncheon and dinner, instead
of drinking anything with any meal except
your breakfast. If you try that
treatment for a week, you will be glad
that you looked at this chapter of the
Guide. <span class='sc'>Nutrition</span> (Vol. 19, p. 920), by
Prof. Noel Paton and Dr. Cathcart, describes
the process of nourishment and
shows how important it is to chew the
food thoroughly, not only in order to
break it up, but also in order to combine
with it a sufficient supply of the chemical
juices which come from the glands in the
mouth. <span class='sc'>Dietetics</span> (Vol. 8, p. 214) shows
what use your body makes of each kind
of food that you eat. This article, by the
late Dr. Atwater of the United States
Department of Agriculture, who conducted
the famous government investigation
of diet, and R. D. Milner,
also of the Department, contains tables
showing the amount of nourishment required
by persons who are doing light or
heavy muscular work, as well as by those
who lead a sedentary life. It will interest
you to see (p. 218) how the food of an
American business man compares with
that of an American working in a lumber
camp. The article <span class='sc'>Dietary</span> (Vol. 8, p.
212), describing the food given to prisoners,
soldiers and sailors in various parts
of the world, contains some striking information
as to the possibilities of the
simple life. In Sweden prisoners get only
two meals a day, and those consisting
chiefly of porridge or gruel; and the “punishment
diet” in English prisons is one
pound of bread a day, and nothing else
but water. The article <span class='sc'>Water Supply</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 387), by G. F. Deacon, deals
with the storage and distribution of water,
and shows how it should be filtered for
drinking. <span class='sc'>Sewerage</span> (Vol. 24, p. 735)
describes the sanitary systems which prevent
the pollution of streams and wells.
<span class='sc'>Mineral Waters</span> (Vol. 18, p. 517) describes
the great variety of springs from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>which the table-waters in general use are
obtained. Their medicinal values are
also indicated, and in the table which
classifies thirty of the most important
American springs it is curious to see that
nearly all of them lie in the Appalachian
Mountain chain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hurtful Foods</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Vegetarianism</span> (Vol. 27, p. 967), by
Dr. Josiah Oldfield, describes the various
systems of diet which reject flesh, the
most extreme of which exclude everything
but nuts, fruit and cereals, all to be
eaten raw. <span class='sc'>Cookery</span> (Vol. 7, p. 74)
shows how the digestibility of food is influenced
by methods of cooking, and unhesitatingly
condemns the general practice
of baking meat. <span class='sc'>Adulteration</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 218), by Dr. Otto Hehner, describes
the dangers to health which arise
from the use of preservatives as well as
substitutes. For the use of boracic acid,
which has been proved to be slightly unwholesome,
but not really dangerous,
there is at any rate the excuse that it
keeps food from spoiling, but the article
has nothing but
blame for the “coppering”
of vegetables.
“Many years ago some artful, if
stupid, cook found that green vegetables
like peas or spinach, when cooked in a
copper pan, by preference a dirty one,
showed a far more brilliant colour than
the same vegetable cooked in earthenware
or iron. The manufacturer who puts up
substances like peas in pots or tins for
sale produces the same effect which the
cook obtained by the wilful addition of a
substance known to be injurious to
health, namely, sulphate of copper.”
<span class='sc'>Food Preservation</span> (Vol. 10, p. 612)
also shows the risks of using carelessly
canned goods. <span class='sc'>Temperance</span> (Vol. 26, p.
578), by Dr. Arthur Shadwell, tells the
story of the reforms that have been
effected since the 18th century days when
London bars used to put up signs inviting
customers to get “drunk for one penny”
or “dead drunk for twopence;” and
<span class='sc'>Liquor Laws</span> (Vol. 16, p. 759) describes
temperance legislation in all parts of the
world, with a most interesting section on
prohibition in the United States. <span class='sc'>Drunkenness</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 601) deals specifically
with the effects of excess on the health.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Alimentary Canal</span> (Vol. 1, p. 663), by
Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, describes all the
organs of the body that deal with food.
<span class='sc'>Digestive Organs</span> (Vol. 8, p. 262), by
Dr. Andrew Gillespie, shows how indigestion
arises, and <span class='sc'>Dyspepsia</span> (Vol. 8, p.
786) describes the symptoms caused by
habitual indigestion. <span class='sc'>Metabolic Diseases</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 195), by Dr. Noel
Paton, covers all the maladies arising
from defective nutrition. <span class='sc'>Corpulence</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 192) tells about the reduction
of superfluous fat, while <span class='sc'>Fasting</span> (Vol.
10, p. 193) and <span class='sc'>Hunger and Thirst</span> (Vol.
13, p. 931) discuss the intentional or accidental
cutting down of the usual food
supply. <span class='sc'>Famine</span> (Vol. 10, p. 166) gives a
most interesting account of the disasters
with which crop failures still threaten
Asiatic countries. The feeding of young
children is, of course, a distinct subject,
and is treated in great detail in the article
<span class='sc'>Infancy</span> (Vol. 14, p. 513), by Dr. Harriet
Hennessy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sleep and the Want of it</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sleep</span> (Vol. 25, p. 238), by Prof. McKendrick,
is an elaborate study of the
curious changes in the action of the brain
and other organs
which take place
during slumber.
<span class='sc'>Insomnia</span> (Vol. 14,
p. 644) is a practical article on the causes
and treatment of sleeplessness. Between
absolutely lying awake and obtaining a
really good night’s rest there are many
intermediate stages, and the article
<span class='sc'>Dream</span> (Vol. 8, p. 558) contains a great
deal of curious information about disturbed
sleep. <span class='sc'>Somnambulism</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 393) shows that when dreams are vivid
enough to produce sleepwalking there
must be nervous trouble calling for immediate
treatment. <span class='sc'>Narcotics</span> (Vol.
19, p. 239) describes the dangers of the
drugs to produce sleep; and in <span class='sc'>Hypnotism</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>(Vol. 14, p. 201) and <span class='sc'>Suggestion</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 48) there is a full account of
the treatment frequently used for sleeplessness
and other nervous disorders.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Right Kind of Air</div>

<p class='c007'>The effect of climates upon health is
the subject of a special section (Vol. 6, p.
526) of the article <span class='sc'>Climate</span>. <span class='sc'>Ventilation</span>
(Vol. 27, p.
1008) shows how to
secure fresh air in
the house without
draughts. <span class='sc'>Dust</span> (Vol. 8, p. 713), by Dr.
Aitken, the inventor of the ingenious
machine for counting the particles of
dust floating in the atmosphere, gives a
very full account of the impurities in the
air. <span class='sc'>Heating</span> (Vol. 13, p. 160) contains
descriptions and diagrams of the best
methods of warming houses, and there is
at the end of the article an account of the
system of steam heating employed at
Lockport, N. Y., where buildings anywhere
within three miles of the central
plant are heated at a very moderate cost.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General Hygiene</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Baths</span> (Vol. 3, p. 514), and <span class='sc'>Hydropathy</span>
(Vol. 14, p. 165), and <span class='sc'>Balneotherapeutics</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 284) describe
all the bathing treatments
in which water,
steam and hot
air are employed.
Electric baths are described in <span class='sc'>Electrotherapeutics</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 249), and
<span class='sc'>Aerotherapeutics</span> deals with compressed
air baths. <span class='sc'>Massage</span> (Vol. 17, p.
863), by Dr. Arthur Shadwell, describes
all the systems of rubbing. <span class='sc'>Gymnastics</span>
(Vol. 12, p. 752) gives an account of the
Swedish and other systems of hygienic
exercise; and out-door exercises of every
kind are described in the articles mentioned
in the chapter of <i>Readings in Connection
with Recreations and Vacations</i>.
Two other articles which relate to general
hygiene are <span class='sc'>Disinfectants</span> (Vol. 8, p.
312) and <span class='sc'>Antiseptics</span> (Vol. 2, p. 146).
The proper care of the hair is indicated in
the article <span class='sc'>Baldness</span> (Vol. 3, p. 243),
where prescriptions for lotions are given.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Various Diseases</div>

<p class='c007'>The articles already named cover very
fully the application of medical science
to the ordinary routine of life, and will
help you to regulate
wisely your habits in
regard to eating,
sleeping and to the
general care of your body. It may be
the case that you wish, for your own sake,
or for the sake of some member of your
family, to carry your reading further in
respect to some one disease or some one
part of the body. In the list of articles
at the end of this chapter you will find
more than two hundred, each of which
deals with one disease, such as rheumatism,
catarrh, malaria or neuralgia. In
the case of a very simple trouble you will
find directions for treatment, as for example
in the article <span class='sc'>Corn</span>, where you are
advised to use a solution of salicylic acid
in collodion, or, for a soft corn, to paint
it with spirits of camphor. Where the
trouble is anything more serious, you
should of course consult a doctor, but you
will understand what he tells you all the
better, and worry less, if you have read
an article, which describes the usual
course of the disease.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Parts of the Body</div>

<p class='c007'>Again, you may have a special reason
for wishing to learn all you can about
some one part of the body: the eye, the
ear, or the heart. There
are fifty articles, in the list
below, each dealing with
some one organ or part of
the body. The illustrations in these articles
will help you to understand the
exact position of any trouble which you
have read about in the article on a disease
affecting that particular part. Another
set of articles divides the body into groups
of organs, one dealing with the <span class='sc'>Nervous
System</span>, another with the <span class='sc'>Muscular
System</span>, another with the <span class='sc'>Respiratory
System</span>, and so on. Then you have the
five general articles: <span class='sc'>Anatomy</span>, <span class='sc'>Physiology</span>,
<span class='sc'>Pathology</span>, <span class='sc'>Therapeutics</span> and
<span class='sc'>Surgery</span>, which outline all medical science.
The article <span class='sc'>Medicine</span> gives a complete
history of medical science, and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>section on <i>Modern Progress</i> reviews all
that has been accomplished within recent
years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>More Advanced Study</div>

<p class='c007'>Beginning with the six articles just
mentioned, and then taking the more detailed
articles in the groups into which
their subjects divide
them, it is quite possible
to follow in the
Britannica a complete
course of reading on medicine and
surgery, and you may desire to do that,
just as someone else likes to read about
geology or astronomy. But do not forget
that no amount of reading can give you
more than a theoretical knowledge. When
your doctor discovers what is the nature
of your illness (which is much the most
difficult part of his work), and when he
gives you the treatment you need, his eye
is comparing what it sees in your case,
and his hand is comparing what it
touches in your case, with the thousands
of observations that he has made in the
wards and in the operating theatre of the
hospital. Without going through the
course that he has gone through in the
dissecting room, and studying the living
body as he has studied it, you can never
know what he knows. But you will be a
more understanding patient, and a better
nurse, if occasion brings nursing for you
to do, if you have learned something of
medical science from the Britannica.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER L<br> <span class='c014'>GEOGRAPHY AND EXPLORATION</span></h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>A Library of Geography</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The Britannica devotes nearly one
fourth of all its space to geographical
subjects. You may miss the
full significance of this statement; therefore
let us put it differently. The matter
in the Britannica on geography is equivalent
to more than 100 ordinary volumes
each containing 100,000 words, which,
put on shelves about 5 feet long, would
fill a section in your
library 5 shelves
high. But by the
use of new India
paper, this same material on geography,
combined with three times as much on
other subjects of importance, occupies
in the Britannica less than 3 feet of
shelf space. The unity of plan and treatment
and the high authority of the
Britannica in these articles are far beyond
comparison with that you could get
in the most wisely and carefully selected
hundred volumes on Geography that
would give an equivalent number of
words.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Science as well as a Body of Facts</div>

<p class='c007'>Geographical information is so useful
that the student is likely to overlook
the scientific importance of geography
in itself. The articles
in the Encyclopaedia Britannica
described in this
chapter, besides giving
the fullest information on countries,
cities, towns, rivers, mountains, etc.,
trace the development of the science
from its beginning; and the gradual increase
of geographical knowledge, as
told in the Britannica, is a story of fine
out-of-door adventure, of just the kind
of spirited action that has supplied the
theme of the most popular works of
fiction.</p>

<p class='c007'>This chapter will suggest an outline
course of reading in geography, systematically
grouping the more important
articles in the Britannica.</p>

<p class='c007'>The starting point for this course of
study is the article <span class='sc'>Geography</span> (Vol. 11,
p. 619), equivalent in length to 70 pages
of this Guide, written by Hugh R. Mill,
author of <i>Hints on the Choice of Geographical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Books</i>, etc. The story that it
tells us is a most interesting one.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What Early Writers Taught about the Earth</div>

<p class='c007'>The early Greeks thought of the
earth as a flat disk,
circular or elliptical
in outline; and even
in Homeric times
this supposition had
“acquired a special definiteness by the
introduction of the idea of the ocean
river bounding the whole.” Hecataeus
recognized two continents on the circular
disk. Herodotus, traveler and historian
both (see the article <span class='sc'>Herodotus</span>
Vol. 13, p. 381, by George Rawlinson
and Edward M. Walker), who knew
only the lands around the roughly elliptical
Mediterranean Sea, was certain
that the earth was not a circle because
it was longer from east to west than
from north to south, and he distinguished
<i>three</i> continents, adding Africa
to Europe and Asia. “The effect of
Herodotus’s hypothesis that the Nile
must flow from west to east before
turning north in order to balance the
Danube running from west to east before
turning south lingered in the maps of
Africa down to the time of Mungo Park.”
Aristotle (see also the article <span class='sc'>Aristotle</span>,
Vol. 2, p. 501, by Thomas Case, president
of Corpus Christi College, Oxford,
and author of <i>Physical Realism</i>, etc.,)
was the real founder of scientific geography.
“He demonstrated the sphericity
of the earth by three arguments,
two of which are important&#160;... only
a sphere could always throw a circular
shadow on the moon during an eclipse;
and that the shifting of the horizon and
the appearance of new constellations&#160;...
as one travelled from north to south,
could only be explained on the hypothesis
that the earth was a sphere....
He formed a comprehensive theory of
the variations of climate with latitude
and season&#160;... speculated on the differences
in the character of races of
mankind living in different climates,
and correlated the political forms of
communities with their situation on a
seashore, or in the neighborhood of
natural strongholds.” The article <span class='sc'>Ptolemy</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 618), equivalent to 27
pages of this Guide, by the late Sir
Edward Herbert Bunbury, the historian
of ancient geography, and Dr. C. R.
Beazley, author of <i>The Dawn of Modern
Geography</i>, etc., should be studied in
conjunction with the summary, in the
article <i>Geography</i>, of Ptolemy’s achievements.
“He concentrated in his writings
the final outcome of all Greek geographical
learning,” but his great aim was to
collect and compare all existing determinations
of latitude and estimates of
longitude, and to solve the problem of
representing the curved surface of the
earth on the flat surface of a map.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Geography in the Middle Ages</div>

<p class='c007'>The science of geography was at a
low ebb in Christendom during the
Middle Ages, when verbal interpretation
of the Scriptures led
the Church to oppose
the spherical
theory and also the
theory of the motion of the earth. But
among the Arabs, geography was kept
alive—especially by Al-Mamun (see the
article <span class='sc'>Mamun</span>) (Vol. 17, p. 533), who
had Ptolemy translated into Arabic.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>New World: New Geography</div>

<p class='c007'>The story of the great discoveries of
the 15th and 16th
centuries is outlined
later in the article
<span class='sc'>Geography</span>. The
effect on geographical theory was enormous.</p>

<p class='c020'>The old arguments of Aristotle and the old
measurements of Ptolemy were used by
Toscanelli and Columbus in urging a westward
voyage to India; and mainly on this
account did the crossing of the Atlantic
rank higher in the history of scientific geography
than the laborious feeling out of
the coast-line of Africa. But not until the
voyage of Magellan shook the scales from
the eyes of Europe did modern geography
begin to advance. Discovery had outrun
theory; the rush of new facts made Ptolemy
practically obsolete in a generation,
after having been the fount and origin of
all geography for a millennium.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>In the century and a half after the
discovery of America important theoretical
work was done by Peter Apian,
Sebastian Münster, Philip Cluwer, Nathanael
Carpenter and Bernhard Varenius,
for which see the biographical
articles. The next century (1650–1760)
saw little worth mentioning in geographical
theory or method. Then, with the
sudden burst of activity that so often
follows scientific hibernation, came the
important work of Torbern Bergman,
a Swedish chemist and a pupil of the great
botanist Linnaeus, and the lectures
delivered at Königsberg after 1765 by
the German philosopher Kant. They
both put new stress on physical geography—see
the articles on <span class='sc'>Bergman</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 774) and <span class='sc'>Kant</span> (Vol. 15, p.
662). Alexander von Humboldt and
Karl Ritter (see the articles on both)
in the first half of the 19th century
supported, the one the unity of nature,
and the other the comparative method,
thus preparing the way for Darwin’s
evolutionary theory, which “has become
the unifying principle in geography.”
Since the adoption of this theory, some
of the more important names in geographical
theory—each the subject of an article
in the Britannica which the student
should read—are: Baron von Richthofen,
Hermann Wagner, Elisée Reclus and A.
de Lapparent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Geographical Discovery</div>

<p class='c007'>Early travel and exploration is a story
of varied interest even when we approach
it from the only side on which we have
material—that is
to say “geographical
exploration
from the Mediterranean centre.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Early conquest of outlying peoples by
the warlike kings of Egypt and Assyria
may have momentarily increased geographical
knowledge, but it is unimportant
in the large story. The first
great explorers were the earliest traders,
the Phoenicians and their African colonists,
the Carthaginians, who traded
throughout the Mediterranean, possibly
on the east coast of Africa and in the
northern seas, and almost certainly on
the west coast of Africa. For details

<span class='sc'>Geography</span> (p. 623, Vol. 11), see the
articles <span class='sc'>Phoenicia</span> (Vol. 21, pp. 454–455),
<span class='sc'>Sidon</span>, <span class='sc'>Tyre</span>, <span class='sc'>Ophir</span>, <span class='sc'>Carthage</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Hanno</span>, the African explorer. On
the only Greek explorer of eminence see
the article on <span class='sc'>Pytheas</span> of Marseilles
(Vol. 22, p. 703), who, about 330 B.C.,
explored the British coast and the Baltic,
and may have gone as far north as Iceland.
Alexander the Great (see the biographical
article) and his successors explored
the East, “thus opening direct
intercourse between Grecian and Hindu
civilization.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Romans were poor seamen and
accomplished little as explorers. It has
often been pointed out that the Greeks
spoke of the “watery ways” of the sea,
considering it a highway, but that the
Romans, centuries later too, called the
sea “dissociable,” that is “preventing
and hindering intercourse.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Arabs and Northmen</div>

<p class='c007'>The Arabs were the leading geographers
of the Middle Ages, and among their
great travelers on whom there are separate
articles in the
Britannica are <span class='sc'>Masudi</span>,
<span class='sc'>Ibn Haukal</span>,
<span class='sc'>Idrisi</span>, and in the
14th century <span class='sc'>Ibn Batuta</span>. In the 9th
and 10th centuries, the Norseman Ohthere
rounded the North Cape and saw the
midnight sun; Iceland was colonized
from Norway; Eric the Red discovered
Greenland; and his son Leif Ericsson
sailed along a part of the North American
coast: see the articles <span class='sc'>Iceland</span>, <span class='sc'>Greenland</span>,
<span class='sc'>Vinland</span>, <span class='sc'>Leif Ericsson</span> and
<span class='sc'>Thorfinn Karlsefni</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crusades made Europe a little
more familiar with the East and opened
the way for travel and pilgrimage. In
general see the summary <i>Results of the
Crusades</i> (p. 546, Vol. 7) at the close
of the article <span class='sc'>Crusades</span>; and particularly
see <span class='sc'>Benjamin of Tudela</span> (Vol. 3,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>p. 739) for a Jewish traveler of the 12th
century who went as far east as the
frontiers of China.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>13th Century</div>

<p class='c007'>Before the new age of real exploration
began, in the 15th century, there was an
age of travel, especially
in Asia during the 13th
century, which did much
to rouse popular curiosity about the
ends of the earth. Though these travelers
were not scientifically trained,
modern research shows a remarkable
proportion of fact in their stories. The
great names of this era: Joannes de
Plano Carpini, a friend of St. Francis of
Assisi and head of a Catholic mission to
Mongolia; William of Rubruquis, a
Fleming who went to Tartary under
orders from Louis IX of France; Hayton,
King of Armenia, who traveled in
Mongolia about the middle of the century;
Odoric, a Catholic friar of the 14th
century; and Marco Polo,</p>

<p class='c020'>the first to trace a route across the whole
longitude of Asia, naming and describing
kingdom after kingdom which he had seen;
the first to speak of the new and brilliant
court which had been established at Peking;
the first to reveal China in all its wealth and
vastness, and to tell of the nations on its
borders; the first to tell more of Tibet than
its name, to speak of Burma, of Laos, of
Siam, of Cochin-China, of Japan, of Java,
of Sumatra and of other islands of the
archipelago, of the Nicobar and Andaman
Islands, of Ceylon and its sacred peak, of
India but as a country seen and partially
explored; the first in medieval times to give
any distinct account of the secluded Christian
Empire of Abyssinia, and of the semi-Christian
island of Sokotra, and to speak,
however dimly, of Zanzibar, and of the vast
and distant Madagascar; whilst he carries
us also to the remotely opposite region of
Siberia and the Arctic shores, to speak of
dog-sledges, white bears and reindeer-riding
Tunguses.</p>

<p class='c007'>See the articles <span class='sc'>Carpini</span>, <span class='sc'>Rubruquis</span>,
<span class='sc'>Hayton</span>, <span class='sc'>Odoric</span>, and <span class='sc'>Polo</span>, by C. R.
Beazley, author of <i>The Dawn of Modern
Geography</i>, and Sir Henry Yule, author
of <i>Cathay and the Way Thither</i> and <i>The
Book of Ser Marco Polo</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little later were the Spaniard Ruy
Gonzalez de Clavijo who traveled to
Samarkand; the Italians Nicola de’Conti
whose travels in India were written by
Poggio Bracciolini, secretary to Pope
Eugene IV, and Ludovico di Varthema,
who made the pilgrimage to Mecca in
1503. See the articles <span class='sc'>Clavijo</span>, <span class='sc'>Conti</span>,
<span class='sc'>Poggio</span>, himself a traveler, and <span class='sc'>Varthema</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Portuguese Explorers</div>

<p class='c007'>The construction of the mariner’s
compass gave a new impulse to navigation
and discovery. “Portugal took
the lead along this
new path, and foremost
among her pioneers
stands Prince
Henry the Navigator (1394–1460)....
The great westward projection of the
coast of Africa and the islands to the
north-west of that continent, were the
principal scene of the work of mariners
sent out at his expense; but his object
was to push onward and reach India
from the Atlantic.” The account of
Portuguese discoveries in the article
<span class='sc'>Geography</span> (p. 625) should be supplemented
by the articles <span class='sc'>Henry of Portugal</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 296), by C. R. Beazley,
author of <i>Prince Henry the Navigator</i> and
<i>The Dawn of Modern Geography</i>: <span class='sc'>Diogo
Gomez</span> and <span class='sc'>Bartolomeu Diaz de Novaes</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 172), also by C. R. Beazley,

Gama</span>, <span class='sc'>Prester John</span>, by Sir Henry
Yule, and <span class='sc'>Fernão Mendes Pinto</span>, by
Edgar Prestage, lecturer in Portuguese,
University of Manchester.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Columbus and America</div>

<p class='c007'>We have now come to a point in the
story where it begins to be more familiar
to us all. “The Portuguese, following
the lead of Prince
Henry, continued to
look for the road to
India by the Cape
of Good Hope. The same end was
sought by Christopher Columbus, following
the suggestion of Toscanelli, and
under-estimating the diameter of the
globe, by sailing due west.” The discovery
and early exploration of America
are told in the following articles, selected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>from a long list—see also the chapter in
this Guide on <i>American History</i>:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Columbus</span> and <span class='sc'>Vespucci</span>, both by

<div class='sidenote'>Recent American Exploration</div>

<p class='c007'>Exploration in the United States,
particularly as connected with westward

in the Britannica.

<div class='sidenote'>The Far East</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Orient the principal explorers
mentioned in the article <span class='sc'>Geography</span> and
treated each in a separate article are:
the Englishmen,
<span class='sc'>Sir James Lancaster</span>,
<span class='sc'>Thomas Coryate</span>,
<span class='sc'>Sir Anthony Shirley</span>, <span class='sc'>Sir Thomas

etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Missionaries</div>

<p class='c007'>The geographical work of missionaries
has been remarkable—perhaps none of it
more so than the survey of China by
Jesuit missionaries. “They first prepared
a map of the country
round Peking, which
was submitted to
the emperor Kang-hi, and, being satisfied
with the accuracy of the European
method of surveying, he resolved to have
a survey made of the whole empire on
the same principles. This great work
was begun in July, 1708, and the completed
maps were presented to the
emperor in 1718. The records preserved
in each city were examined, topographical
information was diligently collected,
and the Jesuit fathers checked their
triangulation by meridian altitudes of
the sun and pole star and by a system
of remeasurements. <i>The result was a
more accurate map of China than existed,
at that time, of any country in Europe</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was some 18th century exploration
of importance in Arabia: see the
article <span class='sc'>Karsten Niebuhr</span>; in Africa:
see the articles <span class='sc'>James Bruce</span>; <span class='sc'>John
Ledyard</span>, an American; and <span class='sc'>Mungo
Park</span>; and in South America: see <span class='sc'>C. M.
de la Condamine</span>, <span class='sc'>Pierre Bouguer</span>,
etc. But the Pacific was the great field
of exploration in this century and “the
three voyages of Captain James Cook
form an era in the history of geographical
discovery.” See the articles <span class='sc'>James
Cook</span>, <span class='sc'>Comte de La Perouse</span>, <span class='sc'>Joseph-Antoine
Bruni d’Entrecasteux</span>, <span class='sc'>William
Bligh</span>, <span class='sc'>George Vancouver</span>, and
local articles like <span class='sc'>Hawaii</span>, <span class='sc'>Tahiti</span>, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arctic Exploration</div>

<p class='c007'>The story of Polar exploration is told
in brief in the article <span class='sc'>Geography</span> (p. 629)
but there are more detailed accounts
in the article
<span class='sc'>Polar Regions</span>, by
H. R. Mill and Fridtjof
Nansen, the polar
explorer, which is illustrated with maps
of the North Polar and South Polar
regions. This should be further supplemented
by the following biographical

Regions</span> includes an elaborate account
of the physiography of the Arctic region
(p. 954, Vol. 21) and of the Antarctic
(p. 969 of same Vol.), dealing with geology,
climate, pressure, flora, fauna, people,
ocean depths, temperature and salinity,
and marine biological conditions, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Maps</div>

<p class='c007'>The student of geography should read
with great care the article <span class='sc'>Map</span> (Vol. 17,
p. 629), equivalent to 110 pages of this
Guide, written by Lieut.
Col. Charles Frederick
Close, author of <i>Text-Book
of Topographical Surveying</i>, Alexander
Ross Clark, lately in charge of the trigonometrical
operations of the British
Ordnance Survey, and Dr. Ernest George
Ravenstein, author of <i>A Systematic Atlas</i>,
etc. The article has 59 illustrations and
it deals with: classification, scale, delineation
of ground, contours, selection
of names and orthography; measurement
on maps; relief maps; globe; map
printing; history of cartography (equivalent
to 55 pages of this Guide), with
reproductions of many early maps;
topographical surveys, summarizing the
work done in different parts of the world;
and map projections.</p>

<p class='c007'>The maps in the Britannica are of
the utmost value. They include nearly
150 full-page maps, many of them in
colours, all prepared especially for this
edition, and in accordance with the principles
laid down in the article <span class='sc'>Map</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Physiographic Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>Of articles on physiographic topics
possibly the most important are those
on the several continents, each accompanied
by a map in colours from the
great German cartographic establishment
of Justus Perthes,
Gotha. Of particular
importance to
the American reader
are the contributions of Prof. W. M.
Davis of Harvard on physiography
in the articles <span class='sc'>America</span> and <span class='sc'>North
America</span>, and of J. C. Branner, now
president of Leland Stanford University,
on <span class='sc'>South America</span>. Then read the
article <span class='sc'>Ocean and Oceanography</span>, by
Dr. Otto Krümmel, professor of geography
at Kiel and author of <i>Handbuch
der Ozeanographie</i>, and H. R. Mill,
editor of <i>The International Geography</i>.
This single article is equivalent to 65
pages of this Guide. Then study the
articles on the different seas—for instance,
<span class='sc'>Atlantic Ocean</span>, by H. N.
Dickson, author of <i>Papers on Oceanography</i>,
etc.; <span class='sc'>Pacific Ocean</span>, by the
same author, with a section on its islands,
and with a map in colours; Dr. Dickson’s
article on the <span class='sc'>Mediterranean Sea</span>;
the article <span class='sc'>Great Lakes</span>, the separate
article on each of these lakes, <span class='sc'>Great
Salt Lake</span>, etc., and the article <span class='sc'>Lake</span>,
by Sir John Murray, the famous British
geographer, which contains statistical
tables of the important lakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two important general articles are:
<span class='sc'>Climate and Climatology</span>, with 2
plates, 13 figures and several tables, by
R. DeCourcy Ward, professor of climatology,
Harvard; and <span class='sc'>Meteorology</span>, by
Dr. Cleveland Abbe, professor of meteorology,
U. S. Weather Bureau. These
articles, both by Americans, deal with
these subjects with particular attention
to American conditions. They should
be supplemented by a study of the
articles: <span class='sc'>Sky</span>; <span class='sc'>Atmospheric Electricity</span>;
<span class='sc'>Clouds</span>, illustrated with remarkably fine
pictures of the different cloud-types;
and the separate articles on meteorological
instruments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Britannica Gazetteer</div>

<p class='c007'>What has already been said, although
it suggests rather than exhausts the
subject of geography in the Britannica,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>will show that the student will find in it
a text-book of geography
which is unparalleled
elsewhere
in size, scope, authority
and interest. Besides, the
Britannica contains the equivalent of a
great gazetteer and atlas. Place-names
are so entered in the Index (Vol. 29)
that their location on maps may be discovered
immediately and the articles on
towns, villages, cities, states, etc., are full
and authoritative. The reader who turns
to an article in the Britannica on some
small town or city with a population
of 5,000 or less finds there within the
limits of a few lines of print the results
of elaborate research and laborious
correspondence with local authorities.
Such articles give not merely location,
population, railway service, commercial
and manufacturing information, description
of buildings, etc., but a historical
sketch of the place, in which every date
and detail has been verified with no sparing
of expense or pains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Britannica as a Guide Book</div>

<p class='c007'>The Encyclopaedia Britannica is not
merely a geographical
text-book and
gazetteer, however.
It is an excellent
guide book. The same care in details
that makes it valuable as a gazetteer
makes it a wonderful companion for
the traveler, full of literary charm and
readableness. Such articles as <span class='sc'>New
York</span>, <span class='sc'>Philadelphia</span>, <span class='sc'>Boston</span>, <span class='sc'>San
Francisco</span> and <span class='sc'>St. Louis</span> contain valuable
sketches of the culture, literary and
artistic, of these cities. The world’s
“show” and vacation spots have elaborate
treatment—for instance the English <span class='sc'>Lake
District</span>, <span class='sc'>Riviera</span>, <span class='sc'>Catskills</span>, <span class='sc'>Lake
George</span>, <span class='sc'>Yosemite</span>, <span class='sc'>Grand Canyon</span>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the student can turn immediately
in the Britannica, as he could in
no book purely geographical, from the
description of a locality, say Mount Vernon,
Stockbridge, Cooperstown, Tarrytown
or Salem, to the biographies that
these articles make him need,—Washington,
Jonathan Edwards, Cooper, Irving
and Hawthorne. See the last chapter
in this Guide for an illustration of this
use of the Britannica.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following list of <i>general</i> articles on
geography will give the reader an idea of
the great scope of the Britannica in geographical
literature. If this list included
all the geographical articles in the Britannica
it would be nearly 60 times as
long. For a complete list classified by
different continents and countries see the
Index Volume, beginning on p. 895.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LI<br> <span class='c014'>ANTHROPOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>These two sciences are devoted to
the study of mankind before written
history began; and they have
an interest for every reader who has
asked, when he was a child and had a
story told him: “What happened <i>before</i>
that?” In the chapter in this Guide on
<i>Language and Writing</i>, we have told the
story of those two great inventions which
made civilization possible. The present
chapter is devoted to the story of man
before writing was commonly used—that
is, before historical documents could
exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as the study of children and their
habits is something new and peculiarly
characteristic of the last generation, so
these sciences of anthropology and ethnology
which deal with the childhood of
the human race are of recent origin. But
in comparison with child-psychology
these two sciences are at a disadvantage
in a very important respect: there are always
children to be studied, but the
childhood of the race is long past and
remote from the student of it, save for
the primitive tribes which can still be
observed, and even these tribes are now
scattered and few, and by contact with
civilization they are rapidly losing the
characteristics which invite scientific
study. A hundred years ago, the opportunities
for experiment and observation
were far greater, but at that time savages
were not seriously studied. There could,
indeed, be no “science of man” before the
evolutionary theory of Darwin, Wallace
and Huxley had been generally accepted.
Throughout this Guide we see how
this theory has affected all our modern
thought, modified our sciences, and even
created new sciences. The Eleventh Edition
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica
may, indeed, be described as the authoritative
and interesting story of the human
activities, critically studied from the
point of view of evolution. The trustworthy
material is chiefly derived from
observations in Australia, in the South
Seas, among the North American Indians
and among the still savage tribes of
Africa, and from studies of the tools and
other remains of early peoples. All broad
conclusions must be based upon the similarity
of customs among races widely
separated by time and place, and upon
the fact that some traces of such customs
are still found among more highly civilized
peoples.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first article in a course of reading
on the “science of man” in the Britannica
is <span class='sc'>Anthropology</span> (Vol. 2, p. 108),
equivalent to 40 pages in this Guide, illustrated,
by Prof. Tylor, of Oxford University,
one of the founders of the science,
and author of <i>Researches into the Early
History of Mankind</i>, <i>Primitive Culture</i>,
etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Man’s Origin</div>

<p class='c007'>This great article deals first with
“man’s place in Nature,” the most interesting
branch of the theory of evolution.
Prof. Tylor traces
back the recognition
of man’s structural
similarity to the higher apes to Linnaeus
(1735) and to the less scientific Lord
Monboddo (1774 and 1778), whose simple
literary style as well as his theory of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>the descent of man aroused the amusement
and scorn of Dr. Samuel Johnson,
who said that Monboddo was “as jealous
of his tail as a squirrel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Tylor remarks that:</p>

<p class='c020'>There are few ideas more ingrained in ancient
and low civilization than that of relationship
by descent between the lower animals
and man. Savage and barbaric religions
recognize it, and the mythology of the
world has hardly a more universal theme.
But in educated Europe such ideas had long
been superseded by the influence of theology
and philosophy, with which they seemed too
incompatible.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in 1843 Dr. J. C. Prichard, to whom
Tylor gives the title that many would
give to Tylor himself, “founder of modern
anthropology,” insisted that</p>

<p class='c020'>man is but an animal&#160;... composed
of the same materials, and framed on the
same principles, as the creatures which he
has tamed to be the servile instruments of
his will, or slays for his daily food.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Tylor shows how Wallace and Darwin
established a theory of human descent,
and sums up the similarities and
dissimilarities in anatomical construction
between man and the man-like apes.
Even more interesting is what the article
says (p. 110) about “assigning to man
his place in nature on psychological
grounds.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Huxley acknowledged an immeasurable
and practically infinite divergence, ending
in the present enormous psychological gulf
between ape and man. It is difficult to account
for this intellectual chasm as due to
some minor structural difference....
Beyond a doubt, man possesses, and in some
way possesses by virtue of his superior brain,
a power of co-ordinating the impressions of
his senses, which enables him to understand
the world he lives in, and by understanding
to use, resist, and even in a measure rule it.
No human art shows the nature of this human
attribute more clearly than does language</p>

<p class='c007'>—although other animals have a sort of
language. The article quotes Dr. A.
Russel Wallace’s conclusion that man
stands “apart, as not only the head and
culminating point of the grand series of
organic nature, but as in some degree a
new and distinct order of being.” And
another great anatomist, Prof. St. George
Mivart, says “Man’s animal body must
have had a different source from that of
the spiritual soul which informs it, owing
to the distinctness of the two orders to
which these existences severally belong.”
Dr. Tylor, in citing these authorities, adds
that “man embodies an immaterial and
immortal, spiritual principle which no
lower creature possesses, and which
makes the resemblance of the apes to
him but a mocking simulance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer to the question “How did
man originate?” depends on the answer
to the question “How did species originate?”
The main points are summed up
in the article <span class='sc'>Anthropology</span> (on p. 112),
which also deals with the fossil remains of
man, especially skulls, and their bearing
on the question. A more detailed discussion
will be found in the articles <span class='sc'>Evolution</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 22) and <span class='sc'>Species</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 616).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Races of Man</div>

<p class='c007'>The classification of man into different
races is the topic next taken up by Dr.
Tylor in the article <span class='sc'>Anthropology</span>, and
he deals particularly
with classification by
the “facial angle”
(on which see also the article <span class='sc'>Craniometry</span>,
Vol. 7, p. 372). Different classifications
are criticized and the article decides
that “Huxley’s division probably
approaches more nearly than any other
to such a tentative classification as may
be accepted.... He distinguishes four
principal types of mankind, the Australioid,
Negroid, Mongoloid and Xanthochroic
(fair whites), adding a fifth variety,
the Melanchroic (dark whites).”
That races are not species, zoologically, is
made plain by the fact that the offspring
of parents of different races are fertile—those
of different species being infertile.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Antiquity of Man</div>

<p class='c007'>One of the questions connected with
the origin of man is his antiquity. The
Biblical chronology,
as commonly reckoned
and interpreted,
allowed a time since
the appearance of the original stock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>which seemed far too short for the apparent
variation from the original species
(see <span class='sc'>Chronology</span>, Vol. 6, p. 305). The
natural sciences, notably geology, have
“made it manifest that our earth must
have been the seat of vegetable and animal
life for an immense period of time;
while the first appearance of man, though
comparatively recent, is positively so remote,
that an estimate between twenty
and a hundred thousand years may fairly
be taken as a minimum.” This geological
claim is supported by the evidence of prehistoric
archaeology (see the article
<span class='sc'>Archaeology</span>, Vol. 2, p. 344). In the
caves of France and Belgium human
bones have been found with the remains
of fossil species of elephant, rhinoceros,
hyena, bear, etc., and “the co-existence
of man with a fauna now extinct or confined
to other districts was brought to yet
clearer demonstration by the discovery in
these caves of certain drawings and carvings
of the animals done by the ancient
inhabitants themselves, such as a group
of reindeer on a piece of reindeer horn,
and a sketch of a mammoth, showing the
elephant’s long hair, on a piece of a
mammoth’s tusk from La Madeleine.”
See Fig. 7, Plate facing p. 118, Vol. 2; the
figures of the reindeer and mammoth,
hairy and with upturned tusks, in Plate
II, article <span class='sc'>Archaeology</span> (following p.
348, Vol. 2); and of the reindeer in Plate
I (Vol. 19, p. 462), and the old cave
paintings of wild boars and bison from
Altamira, reproduced in colour on Plate
II, the next page. These paintings,
marking by their technical excellence a
high stage of art if not of civilization, are
said by geologists to date back 50,000
years. The student will be repaid for
turning a moment from the article <span class='sc'>Anthropology</span>
and the question of the antiquity
of man to the article <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cave-Dwellers<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Cave</span> (Vol.
5, p. 573), by the eminent
archaeologist, W. Boyd Dawkins,
and the author of
<i>Cave-hunting</i> and <i>Early Man in Britain</i>.
He reconstructs the civilization of the inhabitants
of the pleistocene caves of the
European continent (p. 576), describes
the carvings and drawings of which we
have just spoken, and says of the cave-dwellers:</p>

<p class='c020'>If these remains be compared with those
of existing races, it will be found that the
cave-men were in the same hunter stage of
civilization as the Eskimos, and that they
are unlike any other races of hunters. If
they were not allied to the Eskimos by blood,
there can be no doubt that they handed down
to the latter their art and their manner
of life. The bone needles, and many of
the harpoons, as well as the flint spearheads,
arrowheads and scrapers, are of precisely
the same form as those now in use amongst
the Eskimos. The artistic designs from the
caves of France, Belgium and Switzerland,
are identical in plan and workmanship with
those of the Eskimos.... The reindeer,
which they both knew, is represented in the
same way by both. The practice of accumulating
large quantities of the bones of animals
round their dwelling-places, and the
habit of splitting the bones for the sake of
the marrow, are the same in both. The hides
were prepared with the same sort of instruments,
and the needles with which they were
sewn together are of the same pattern. The
stone lamps were used by both. In both
there was the same disregard for sepulture.
All these facts can hardly be mere coincidences
caused by both peoples leading a savage
life under similar conditions. The conclusion,
therefore, seems inevitable that, so
far as we have any evidence of the race to
which the cave-dwellers belong, that evidence
points only in the direction of the Eskimos.
It is to a considerable extent confirmed by a
consideration of the animals found in the
caves. The reindeer and musk sheep afford
food to the Eskimos now in the Arctic Circle,
just as they afforded it to the cave-men in
Europe; and both these animals have been
traced by their remains from the Pyrenees
to the north-east through Europe and Asia
as far as the very regions in which they now
live. The mammoth and bison also have been
tracked by their remains in the frozen river
gravels and morasses through Siberia as far
as the American side of Bering Strait.
Palaeolithic man appeared in Europe with
the arctic mammalia, lived in Europe with
them, and in all human probability retreated
to the north-east along with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The antiquity of man may be estimated
also by the time it must have taken
to deposit the soil that overlies traces of
civilization,—for instance in Egypt where
pottery is found 60 feet deep, while inundations
from the Nile probably have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>not averaged more than a few inches in a
century. “The most recent work of
Egyptologists proves a systematic civilization
to have existed in the valley of the
Nile at least 6000 to 7000 years ago.”
Similar testimony is given by examining
the lake-dwellings of Switzerland and the
kitchen middens of Denmark. On these
see the articles <span class='sc'>Lake Dwellings</span> (Vol.
16, p. 91), by Joseph Anderson, keeper of
the National Museum of Antiquities,
Edinburgh, and <span class='sc'>Shell-heaps</span> (Vol. 24, p.
832). The latter article, in a description
of the middens of Denmark, says:</p>

<p class='c020'>Among the bones were those of the wild
bull or aurochs, beaver, seal and great auk,
all now extinct or rare in this region. Moreover,
a striking proof of the antiquity of
these shell-heaps is that they contain full-sized
shells of the common oyster, which cannot
live at present in the brackish waters
of the Baltic except near its entrance, the
inference being that the shores where the
oyster at that time flourished were open to
the salt sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article on <span class='sc'>Lake Dwellings</span> brings
out very clearly the fact that this, like
other early stages of development, is to
be found at widely different periods of
time: in Switzerland, thousands of years
ago; in Scotland and Ireland (see also the
article <span class='sc'>Crannog</span>, Vol. 7, p. 377) during
the Christian era; and in New Guinea and
Central Africa within the last few years.
This is in accordance with the fact that
the human race has not “matured” with
equal rapidity all over the earth—that
even now one race is in infancy, another
in childhood, another in a transition
stage like adolescence, and another in the
prime of civilization.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Language</div>

<p class='c007'>Returning to the article <span class='sc'>Anthropology</span>,
the next topic treated is Language.
The more important points on
this subject are
stated in another
chapter of this part
of the Guide, on <i>Language and Writing</i>.
Dr. Tylor says:</p>

<p class='c020'>For all that known dialects prove to the
contrary, on the one hand, there may have
been one primitive language, from which the
descendant languages have varied so widely,
that neither their words nor their formation
now indicate their unity in long past ages,
while, on the other hand, the primitive
tongues of mankind may have been numerous,
and the extreme unlikeness of such languages
as Basque, Chinese, Peruvian, Hottentot
and Sanskrit may arise from absolute
independence of origin. The language
spoken by any tribe or nation is not of itself
absolute evidence as to its race-affinities.
This is clearly shown in extreme cases. Thus
the Jews in Europe have almost lost the use
of Hebrew, but speak as their vernacular
the language of their adopted nation, whatever
it may be.... In most or all nations of
mankind, crossing or intermarriage of races
has taken place between the conquering invader
and the conquered native, so that the
language spoken by the nation may represent
the results of conquest as much or
more than of ancestry.... On the other
hand, the language of the warlike invader or
peaceful immigrant may yield, in a few
generations, to the tongue of the mass of the
population, as the Northman’s was replaced
by the French, and modern German gives
way to English in the United States.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Development of Civilization</div>

<p class='c007'>The last general topic in the article
<span class='sc'>Anthropology</span> is Development of Civilization.
In connection with it the student
should read the
article <span class='sc'>Civilization</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 403), by
Dr. H. S. Williams,
editor-in-chief of <i>The Historian’s History
of the World</i>, and particularly the first
part of it dealing with early times.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ethnology</div>

<p class='c007'>The comparatively brief article <span class='sc'>Ethnology
and Ethnography</span> (Vol. 9, p.
849) takes up the story of man’s progress
at the point where
<span class='sc'>Anthropology</span>
stops, and deals particularly
with the division of mankind
into separate races. Was pleistocene man
specifically one? The evidence to supply
an answer to this question is of three
kinds: anatomical, physiological and cultural
and psychical. Human bones from
this early period “show differences so
slight as to admit of pathological or other
explanation,” and do not prove that there
were separate species. The physiological
answer, that there was only one species,
is given and explained in the article <span class='sc'>Anthropology</span>:
species cannot breed with
species, and hybrids are infertile. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>third answer is also in the negative.
“The works of early man everywhere present
the most startling resemblance.”
Dr. J. C. Prichard is quoted in the article
as saying that</p>

<p class='c020'>the same inward and mental nature is to be
recognized in all races of men. When we
compare this fact with the observations, fully
established, as to the specific instincts and
separate psychical endowments of all the distinct
tribes of sentient beings in the universe
we are entitled to draw confidently the conclusion
that all human races are of one
species and one family.</p>

<p class='c007'>If man was specifically one, where did
he originate and how did he spread over
the world? “As to man’s cradle-land
there have been many theories, but the
weight of evidence is in favour of Indo-Malaysia.”
The problem of distribution
“has been met by geology, which proves
that the earth’s surface has undergone
great changes since man’s appearance,
and that continents, long since submerged,
once existed, making a complete land
communication from Indo-Malaysia....
Proofs no less cogent are available of the
former existence of an Eurafrican continent,
while the extension of Australia
in the direction of New Guinea is more
than probable.... The western hemisphere
was probably connected with Europe
and Asia, in Tertiary times.” The
article <span class='sc'>Ethnology</span> closes with a description
of the four divisions of the human
race proposed by Huxley, which have
already been enumerated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Separate articles supplementing these
two main articles, <span class='sc'>Anthropology</span> and
<span class='sc'>Ethnology</span>, especially in the field of
comparative anatomy, are: <span class='sc'>Anthropometry</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 119) for physical measurements,
including the Bertillon system
used to identify criminals; <span class='sc'>Brachycephalic</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 366), or short-headed, a
term applied to Indo-Chinese, Savoyards,
Croatians, Lapps, etc.; <span class='sc'>Dolichocephalic</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 388), or long-headed, like
Eskimos, negroes, etc.; <span class='sc'>Mesocephalic</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 179), for the type between the
two; <span class='sc'>Prognathism</span> (Vol. 22, p. 424), for
jaw protrusion; <span class='sc'>Craniometry</span> (Vol. 7, p.
372) and <span class='sc'>Cephalic Index</span> (Vol. 5, p.
684), for the measurement of skulls and

<div class='sidenote'>North American Indians</div>

<p class='c007'>One of the most elaborate ethnological
articles in the Britannica is of particular
interest to Americans, that on <span class='sc'>Indians,
North American</span> (Vol. 14, p. 452), by
Dr. A. F. Chamberlain,
professor of anthropology,
Clark University, Worcester,
Mass. It is equivalent to more than 100
pages of this Guide, and there are also
scores of brief articles on different North
American Indian tribes. A few, only, of
the many interesting topics treated in it
may be mentioned:</p>

<p class='c020'>The name “American Indians”—due
to the mistaken early belief that
the New World was a part of Asia.
“Amerind” a suggested substitute.
Various uses of “Indian.” French
“sauvage” the original of “Siwash.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Popular fallacies of the origin of the
Indians—Welsh, “lost Ten Tribes,”
etc.</p>

<p class='c020'>Linguistic stocks. Table of languages.
General description; varied
character; enormous compound words,
like <i>deyeknonhsedehrihadasterasterahetakwa</i>
for “stove-polish.” Indian literature.</p>

<p class='c020'>Migrations of Indian stocks. Tabular
conspectus of 180 tribes—situation
and population, degree of intermixture,
condition and progress, and authorities
on each.</p>

<p class='c020'>Population, physical characteristics,
race mixture.</p>

<p class='c020'>Culture, arts, industries, religion,
mythology and games.</p>

<p class='c020'>Social organization, contact of Indians
and whites, Indian wars, missions,
Indian talent and capacity, syllabaries
invented by Indians.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>In addition to the articles on Indian
tribes there are many on Indian notables—for
example, <span class='sc'>Pontiac</span>, <span class='sc'>Tecumseh</span>,
<span class='sc'>King Philip</span>, <span class='sc'>Black Hawk</span>, <span class='sc'>Brant</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Sitting Bull</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Central America</div>

<p class='c007'>Interest in the Indians of Central
America, popularly called Aztecs, is
rather archaeological than ethnological.
See in the Britannica the
article <span class='sc'>Central America</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 677), by Dr.
Walter Lehmann, directorial
assistant of the Royal Ethnological
Museum, Munich; and the article <span class='sc'>America</span>,
<i>Ethnology and Archaeology</i> (Vol. 1,
p. 810), by O. T. Mason, late curator,
Department of Anthropology, National
Museum, Washington, dealing with the
Indians of North, Central and South
America in general. The other principal
articles on races or tribes of
unusual ethnographic importance are:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Negro</span> (Vol. 14, p. 344), by Thomas
Athol Joyce, assistant in the Department
of Ethnography, British Museum,—with
a section on the negro in the United
States, by Walter F. Willcox, late chief
statistician, United States Census Bureau;
supplemented by <span class='sc'>Africa</span>, <i>Ethnology</i>
(Vol. 1, p. 325), by Mr. T. A.
Joyce, with a particularly valuable classified
list (p. 329) of African tribal distribution,
which may be made the basis for
further study by reference to articles on
the separate tribes, such as <span class='sc'>Berbers</span>,
<span class='sc'>Kabyles</span>, <span class='sc'>Mzabites</span>, <span class='sc'>Tuareg</span>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Polynesia</span> (Vol. 22, p. 33) for the
Polynesian race; and also <span class='sc'>Samoa</span> (Vol.
24, p. 115) and <span class='sc'>Hawaii</span> (Vol. 13, p. 83)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Australia</span>, <i>Aborigines</i> (Vol. 2, p. 954)

<div class='sidenote'>Terminology</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>The technical terms of nearly every
science are words coined from Latin and
Greek roots, so that the student of these
languages is at an
advantage in learning
any science—its
terms have some meaning to him no matter
how strange the science itself. But in
anthropology and ethnology we come
across such terms as <i>taboo</i>, <i>totem</i>, <i>shaman</i>
and <i>manitou</i>. For their comprehension
Latin and Greek give no aid. Each of
these terms comes into English from the
language of a primitive people to convey
an idea at once too primitive and too
complex to be expressed by any English
word or by a Greek or Latin compound.
“Taboo” is a Malay word meaning both
“unclean” (as that word is used in the
Old Testament) and “sacred”; and the
idea it conveys is characteristic of the
religious and social system found among
the Polynesians and nearly all other
peoples in a comparatively low stage of
civilization, which sets persons or things
apart as sacred or accursed. “Totem”
is a Chippewa (North American Indian)
word denoting an animal, plant, or other
object chosen as the name of a whole family
or tribal division. The word “shaman”
comes from the Ural-Altaic (Tungus),
and means “medicine-man,” a combination
of priest, magician and exorcist.
“Manitou” is another North American
word meaning “spirit” or “genius.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Taboo and Totem</div>

<p class='c007'>The practice of taboo and totemism,
although one word comes to us from the
South Seas and the other from the American
Indians, is found
all over the less civilized
world, and—even
more important—it
explains many things in the social
and religious life of more civilized communities.
For instance, the account by
modern students of Greek and Roman
religion has had to be largely rewritten
in the light of what we have learned in
the last two generations about taboo and
totemism.</p>

<p class='c007'>The articles <span class='sc'>Taboo</span> (Vol. 26, p. 337)
and <span class='sc'>Totemism</span> (Vol. 27, p. 79) are both
by Andrew Lang, author of <i>Custom and
Myth</i> and other standard works on folk-lore.
It is unnecessary to outline these
two articles here, as the two words have
been defined, and the importance of the
subject suggested. The reader should
refer to the article on <span class='sc'>Andrew Lang</span> (Vol.
16, p. 171), in which it is said that “he
explained the irrational elements of mythology
as survivals from earlier savagery....”
idealized “savage animism&#160;...
maintained the existence of high spiritual
ideas among savage races, and instituted
comparisons between savage
practices and the occult phenomena
among civilized races.” His appreciation
of the culture of the savage and his
remarkably interesting style should induce
the student to read Lang’s other and
related articles in the Britannica, especially:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Family</span> (Vol. 10, p. 158), (equivalent
to 27 pages of this Guide), dealing particularly
with the question of marriage
as related to totemism, and the practices
of marrying only <i>out</i> of the tribe or
totem, and of marrying only <i>within</i> the
totem (see the articles <span class='sc'>Endogamy</span> and
<span class='sc'>Exogamy</span>, <span class='sc'>Matriarchate</span>, <span class='sc'>Polyandry</span>,
<span class='sc'>Polygamy</span>, <span class='sc'>Levirate</span> and <span class='sc'>Couvade</span>).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Name</span> (Vol. 19, p. 157), which discusses
the relation of the name to the totem, the
strange primitive custom of the individual’s
having many names and concealing
his true name, etc.; and also the articles
<span class='sc'>Fairy</span> (Vol. 10, p. 134) and <span class='sc'>Mythology</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 128).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Religion</div>

<p class='c007'>For special forms of superstition, read
the articles <span class='sc'>Magic</span>, <span class='sc'>Shamanism</span>, <span class='sc'>Witchcraft</span>,
<span class='sc'>Demonology</span> and <span class='sc'>Lycanthropy</span>,
and in the field of religion,
<span class='sc'>Religion</span>, <i>Primitive</i>
(Vol. 23, p. 63), by R. R.
Marett, of Oxford University, author of
<i>The Threshold of Religion</i>, etc. This article
puts particular stress on the importance
of ritual in early religion. Compare
also the matter, already mentioned, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>religion in the article on North American
Indians with the short articles <span class='sc'>Manitou</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 568) and <span class='sc'>Ghost Dance</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 925). Besides, the student
should road <span class='sc'>Ordeal</span> (Vol. 20, p. 173),
<span class='sc'>Prayer</span> (Vol. 22, p. 256), <span class='sc'>Ritual</span> (Vol.
23, p. 370), <span class='sc'>Sacrifice</span> (Vol. 23, p. 980),
<span class='sc'>Animism</span> (Vol. 2, p. 53), on the attempt
to explain religion as due to the fear and
worship of ghosts—and <span class='sc'>Fetishism</span> (Vol.
10, p. 295), by N. W. Thomas, government
anthropologist to Southern Nigeria;
<span class='sc'>Ancestor-Worship</span> (Vol. 1, p. 945),
<span class='sc'>Funeral Rites</span> (Vol. 11, p. 329) and
<span class='sc'>Purification</span> (Vol. 22, p. 660), all by
Dr. F. C. Conybeare, author of <i>Myth,
Magic and Morals</i>, etc.; <span class='sc'>Tree-Worship</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 235) and <span class='sc'>Serpent-Worship</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 676), both bearing on totemism,
by S. A. Cook, author of <i>Religion of
Ancient Palestine</i>, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Biographical Study</div>

<p class='c007'>A course of reading on anthropology
may well close with the study in the
Britannica of the lives of some leaders in
this science. The
student will thus be
familiarized with the
theories of each great
anthropologist—and will notice the manifold
appeal of the science by seeing from
what point each approached it—one from
his interest in geology, another from travel,
a third because of his studies in surgery
or biology, another as a psychologist.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LII<br> <span class='c014'>MATHEMATICS</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>There is no single book in the
English language, save the Britannica,
in which the whole body
of mathematical knowledge is examined
and classified with special reference to
the inter-relation of its various parts
and to the results obtained in the neighboring
domains of physics, chemistry,
and engineering. Text-books necessarily
have a somewhat narrow purpose, namely
to teach the student how to solve problems
in a single given field; wide views
over the surrounding country can, therefore,
seldom be afforded. The Britannica,
however, does for English readers,
what the <i>Encyclopädie der Mathematischen
Wissenchaften</i> does for German,
and more, in that in the Britannica the
shadowy borderlands are illuminated
and the roads cleared which connect
the mathematical and the experimental
sciences. In fact if anyone possessed
every mathematical text-book that had
ever been published, he would still find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>the articles full of suggestion to him,
for in them the whole subject has been
presented, in all its complex bearings,
logically and as a whole.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>History</div>

<p class='c007'>It is nearly 4,000 years since a mathematician
was last deified in the person
of Amenophis, and as far as can be ascertained
only one other of
his calling ever received
this honour, and he also
was an Egyptian who had entered into
his godship a full thousand years earlier
(Vol. 9, p. 46). To the ancient Egyptians
mathematics owes the first fragmentary
ideas of arithmetic and mensuration,
but little else, for despite their
amazing mechanical achievements very
little record of purely mathematical
knowledge has come down from them.
It was the Greeks, starting with Thales
(600 B.C.), who really created the sciences
of geometry and numbers. To
them we owe the great abstract ideas
which dominate the science. The Greek
period lasted till the capture of Alexandria
by the Mohammedans, A.D. 640,
at which time the Arabian school took
shape, and to it we owe the development
of algebra (<i>al-jebr-wa’l-muqubala</i>, which
means the transposition and removal
[of terms of an equation]). With the
Renaissance the centre of scientific research
shifted to Western Europe and
from then on the boundaries of mathematical
knowledge were rapidly extended,
till to-day the subject is the common
ground on which all the physical sciences
meet. The student is referred to the
article <span class='sc'>Mathematics</span> (Vol. 17, p. 878),
by A. N. Whitehead, fellow and senior
lecturer in mathematics, Trinity College,
Cambridge, for a brilliant exposition
of the foundations of the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>The professed mathematician will, of
course, not need any set guide to his reading,
but it may be well to point out one or
two articles which he will find especially
worthy of his attention.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Leading Articles</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Probability</span>, (Vol. 22,
p. 376), by Professor Edgeworth, author
of <i>Mathematical Psychics</i>, and numerous
papers on the calculus
of probabilities,
gives, to the
best of our belief,
the only statement of the whole problem
in the English language. That on <span class='sc'>Algebraic
Forms</span> (Vol. 1, p. 620), by
Major Macmahon, former president of
the London Mathematical Society, includes
a number of results not previously
published. The article <span class='sc'>Elasticity</span> (Vol.
9, p. 141), by A. E. H. Love, professor
of natural philosophy in the University
of Oxford, embodies the experience of
a distinguished mathematician who has
made this subject the object of his special
study for years. Sir George Darwin
(son of Charles Darwin) in the article
<span class='sc'>Tide</span> (Vol. 26, p. 938) summed up the
results of his life’s work. The new
electrical theory of the properties of
<span class='sc'>Matter</span> (Vol. 17, p. 891) is discussed
by Sir J. J. Thomson, professor of physics,
Cambridge, who has done more
than anyone else to develop it. There
are many other valuable articles, e.g.,
<span class='sc'>Geometry</span>, <i>Axioms</i> (Vol. 11, p. 730),
and <span class='sc'>Geometry</span>, <i>Non-Euclidean</i> (Vol.
11, p. 724), by A. N. Whitehead; <span class='sc'>Units,
Dimensions of</span> (Vol. 27, p. 736), by
Professor J. A. Fleming; <span class='sc'>Energy</span> and
<span class='sc'>Energetics</span> (Vol. 9, p. 398 and p. 390),
by Sir Joseph Larmor; <span class='sc'>Groups</span>, by Prof.
Burnside, author of <i>Theory of Groups of
Finite Order</i>. Articles which will be
found highly useful to the engineer are
<span class='sc'>Mensuration</span> (Vol. 18, p. 134); <span class='sc'>Earth,
Figure of</span> (Vol. 8, p. 801); <span class='sc'>Geodesy</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 607); <span class='sc'>Strength of Materials</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 1007).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Leading Contributors</div>

<p class='c007'>The mathematician will at once recognize
the peculiar fitness of the contributors
to deal with the subjects allotted
to them, and this

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LIII<br> <span class='c014'>ASTRONOMY</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>No greater homage has ever been
paid to the progress of American
science than when the planning
and supervision of the astronomical section
of the new Encyclopaedia Britannica
was entrusted to the late Prof. Simon
Newcomb, who was also the only American
save Benjamin Franklin ever elected
an associate of the French Institute. His
death occurred some time before the
Britannica was completed, but he had
already finished the articles which he had
undertaken personally to contribute, and
read a great number of the other articles
which had, at his suggestion, been assigned
to eminent astronomers in various
parts of the world. His famous hand-book,
<i>Popular Astronomy</i>, has been translated
into all the European languages,
and into Japanese as well; but the unlimited
resources in the way of collaboration
which the editorial organization of
the Britannica put at his disposal, enabled
him to assemble in these volumes a
complete body of astronomical knowledge
which is the greatest of his educational
achievements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The making of a lens for a great telescope
is the most difficult undertaking in
all craftsmanship, and the mounting of
the telescope itself a triumph of mechanical
ingenuity. Yet the stars and planets
have been guide-posts for the shepherd
and the sailor throughout the ages, and
have told the farmer when to sow and
when to reap, and, even in our day, observations
made by an amateur, through
a common field-glass, have in more than
one instance yielded results of serious
value.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Few Facts</div>

<p class='c007'>Progress is from one point of view so
slow that astronomers are now compiling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>data regarding fixed stars of which the
motion cannot be
deduced for centuries
to come; yet
some of the changes to be observed are
so swift that solar prominences often rise
at the rate of 350,000 miles an hour, and
have been seen to rise to that height. The
temperature of the sun’s envelope, 6000°
C., greatly exceeds any that we can artificially
create, and would convert into
gas any substance we know; and for every
unit of heat it sends to the earth, a hundred
million other units, poured into
space, are absolutely lost for any purposes
of mechanical effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Astronomy deals with objects so minute
that even a shooting star evolving,
as it passes through our atmosphere, so
much light that we can trace its course
with the naked eye, may be no larger
than a grain of sand; deals, too, with objects
of so shadowy a nature that the
white clouds in our sky are, in comparison,
solid blocks; and deals, again, with
distances and surfaces so vast that numerical
description fails to convey any
impression but one of confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not easy to conceive, when we see
a balloon in the air, the remainder that
would exist if the bag, the car, and the
cordage were all subtracted. There
would be, until the gas mixed with the
atmosphere, a sphere of gas. The stars,
our sun included, seem to be masses of
incandescent gas, possessing fairly definite
boundaries, and not far from spherical
in shape; the nebulae seem also to be
masses of incandescent gas, irregular in
form and having no clearly marked limits;
even the nucleus of a comet is apparently
not solid enough to be opaque;
and as the four great planets also seem to
be gaseous, it is probable that only the
smaller bodies, like our earth, the moon,
and Mars, are solid.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the rule that we can handle none of
the matter that originates beyond the
limits of our atmosphere, the meteorites
supply an exception. Seventy years ago,
a mass of stone, cold and invisible, flying
through the aether of space at the rate of
some hundred thousand miles an hour,
entered our atmosphere, became so hot,
as the air’s friction checked its speed,
that bits of its surface, fused to crust,
flicked off and floated in the air, leaving a
shining trail; then as its speed was reduced
to some three hundred miles an
hour, cooled until it was no hotter than
a laundress likes her iron to be. At Mhow,
in India, as it made a dent in the earth,
it killed a man—the only man known to
history who has died so uncanny a death.
But near Wold Cottage, in Yorkshire,
England, thirty years before, another
meteorite had fallen only ten yards from
a labourer; and only thirty years ago another
arrived on a Yorkshire railway line,
forty yards from a gang of platelayers.
The largest meteoric mass known weighs
about fifty tons, but most of them seem to
have split in the course of their journey;
and at Hessle, a hundred thousand fragments
spread, like grapeshot from a giant
gun, over an area of some thirty square
miles. See <span class='sc'>Meteorite</span> (Vol. 18, p. 262).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Life on Mars</div>

<p class='c007'>Although the closest scrutiny has not
discovered in any meteorite a shred of
life, even the lowest, we obtain, from another
source, and by
a different method of
observation, evidence—as
yet inconclusive,—that not
only life, but intelligent life exists beyond
our planet. As in respect of other astronomical
problems, the Britannica is singularly
clear, impartial and authoritative
in its treatment of this question. The
article <span class='sc'>Mars</span> (Vol. 17, p. 761) was written
by Professor Newcomb, but Professor
Percival Lowell contributes a summary
of the recent investigations and deductions
relating to Mars with which his
name is associated. In 1877, Schiaparelli,
adopting the old belief now abandoned
by all astronomers, that oceans occupied
the darker-coloured regions of Mars, observed
dark streaks connecting these
dark patches, and, believing them to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>strips of water, described them by the
Italian word “canale,” by which he
meant channels, or natural bodies of
water. An absurd misconception of his
meaning gave wide currency to the idea
that these strips were artificial <i>canals</i>, a
manifest impossibility, as they are many
miles in width. No canal, properly so
called, could be so wide, and no reservoir
could conceivably be so extensive. There
is, in the existence of such patches,
even if they were bodies of water, as no
one now believes them to be, not the
slightest indication of excavation. In
1894, Professor Lowell, an American astronomer
of great authority, established,
for the special purpose of observing Mars,
the Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff, in
Arizona, 7,250 feet above sea level, in
singularly clear, dry air, equipped with a
twenty-four-inch telescope. This observatory
unquestionably commands greater
penetration than any other, and Professor
Newcomb says that the work there upon
Mars “has been continued with such care
and assiduity that its results must take
precedence of all others.” Professor
Lowell’s first announcement that he had
detected evidences of the existence of extensive
artificial canals, which would of
course absolutely prove Mars to be inhabited
by intelligent creatures, was received
with derision by many critics who
jumped to the conclusion that he meant
artificial canals many miles in width.
Fuller statements from Professor Lowell
showed that he believed Schiaparelli’s
wide strips to be not water, <i>but areas of
vegetation lying on each side of artificial
irrigating canals of no extraordinary
width</i>, by a network of which water is
brought to, and distributed throughout,
the temperate and equatorial zones of
Mars from the extreme North and South,
as the polar snow caps melt; and that
this irrigation gives the rainless area a
seasonal fertility, just as the melting of
Abyssinian snows fecundates the distant
valley of the lower Nile. These strips,
according to Professor Lowell and other
observers, are at one season of a bluish-green
colour suggesting prosperous vegetation,
then fade to a paler shade or in
some places to a tawny brown. The
strips are thousands of miles in length,
perfectly straight. No one claims to
have seen the artificial canals, but if there
are areas of vegetation, they must be due
to irrigation performed by waterways. If
continued observations confirm the existence
of these strips, it will become certain
that they are not telescopic illusions, but
the results of engineering operations on
a scale unknown to our planet. The
readings indicated in this chapter will
yield a survey of this special field, as of
all other fields of current research in
astronomy, and give new interest to current
investigations.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Early Ideas of the World</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>More than two thousand years
ago the poet Lucretius, reviewing
the physical knowledge and theories
of the Greeks, described, as the
Britannica tells us, how “the world was
formed by the conjunctions of streams of
atoms, which condensed into the earth,
with its attendant
water, air, and aether,
to form a self-contained
whole,”
and went on to tell how in the changes of
infinite time all possible forms of life appeared,
but only those fittest to survive
persisted. Here we have an unconscious
anticipation of the nebular hypothesis
and the theory of natural selection, two
of the most tremendous of modern speculations.
Four hundred years earlier
Democritus, the greatest of the Greek
natural philosophers, had said: “According
to convention there is a sweet and a
bitter, and according to convention there
is colour. In truth there are atoms and
a void.” Democritus came near announcing
the doctrines of the indestructibility
of matter and the conservation
of energy, yet the conventions which he
assailed persisted for generations: colour,
taste and other qualities of a substance
being regarded as of its essence and as
much realities as the substance itself.
The theories of the Greeks in fact held
the field for centuries, until, during the
Renaissance, men’s minds attacked the
secrets of nature in a more modern
spirit. Yet, long as has been its history,
physical science, as we know it to-day, is
but a few years old, the result of the
feverish activity which has been the obsession
of the generation now passing
(Vol. 24, p. 396).</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many entertaining touches
in the historical account of the development
of the physical sciences with which
this section of the Britannica is enriched,
for every branch of the subject has been
treated from the historical point of view.
The articles, too, have been written by
masters who can describe clearly because
they see clearly, and no reader, desiring a
sound knowledge of the general principles
on which science rests, and of the conclusions
to which the latest investigations
have directed scientific thought, will go
away empty handed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The section of the Physical Sciences in
the Britannica covers, of course, an enormous
field which for general purposes
may be conveniently divided into:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>i</i>)<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span></dt>
    <dd><i>Matter and Motion</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>ii</i>)</dt>
    <dd><i>Sound</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>iii</i>)</dt>
    <dd><i>Light</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>iv</i>)</dt>
    <dd><i>Heat</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>v</i>)</dt>
    <dd><i>Electricity and Magnetism</i>
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>As a preliminary to any one of these
and to the whole subject the reader will
be well advised to read the article <span class='sc'>Science</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 396), by W. C. D.
Whetham of Trinity College, Cambridge,
author of <i>Recent Development of
Physical Science</i>; those on <span class='sc'>Units, Physical</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 738), and <span class='sc'>Units, Dimensions
of</span> (Vol. 27, p. 736), are also of
fundamental importance; and those on
<span class='sc'>Space and Time</span> (Vol. 25, p. 525), and
<span class='sc'>Time, Measurement of</span> (Vol. 26, p. 983),
may profitably be consulted.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>(<i>I</i>) <i>Matter and Motion</i></h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Matter</div>

<p class='c007'>Since all physical phenomena are manifestations,
in one form or other, of matter
in motion, this first division of the
subject is introductory to
all the rest, and should
preferably be studied first.
The latest theories in connection with the
properties of <span class='sc'>Matter</span> (Vol. 17, p. 891)
are discussed by Sir J. J. Thomson, professor
of experimental physics, Cambridge
University, who has led the way
in the investigation of the electrical theory
of matter. The article is directed to
the establishment of the electronic theory,
and in view of the vast amount of
original work which the author has carried
out in this field, his treatment in the
Britannica should be welcome to all students
of physical science. Supplementing
this are the following: <span class='sc'>Element</span>, by
Wilhelm Ostwald (Nobel Prizeman in
Chemistry, 1909), especially the concluding
remarks (Vol. 9, p. 253); <span class='sc'>Atom</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 870); <span class='sc'>Electricity</span>, <i>Electronic
Theory</i> (Vol. 9, p. 192). Early hypotheses
are described under <span class='sc'>Science</span> (Vol. 24, p.
397); <span class='sc'>Molecules</span> (Vol. 18, p. 654); <span class='sc'>Alchemy</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 521); and modern conceptions
are discussed under <span class='sc'>Liquid
Gases</span>, <i>Cohesion</i> (Vol. 16, p. 756); and
<span class='sc'>Spectroscopy</span> (Vol. 25, p. 625). Reference
should also be made to the articles
<span class='sc'>Density</span> (Vol. 8, p. 46); <span class='sc'>Diffusion</span> (Vol.
8, p. 255); and especially <span class='sc'>Gravitation</span>
(Vol. 12, p. 384), by Professor Poynting
of the University of Birmingham, and
<span class='sc'>Aether</span> (Vol. 1, p. 292), by Sir Joseph
Larmor, secretary of the Royal Society.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Motion</div>

<p class='c007'>The principal articles dealing with motion
are: <span class='sc'>Motion, Laws of</span> (Vol. 18, p.
906), which deals mainly with Newton’s
Laws; and <span class='sc'>Energy</span> (Vol.
9, p. 398), and <span class='sc'>Energetics</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 390), both by
Sir Joseph Larmor. Of as great importance
from the physical point of view are
<span class='sc'>Wave</span> (Vol. 28, p. 424), the part of the
article <span class='sc'>Mechanics</span> dealing with simple
harmonic motion (Vol. 17, p. 975) and
elliptic harmonic motion (p. 978), and
<span class='sc'>Harmonic Analysis</span> (Vol. 12, p. 956),
all by Professor Lamb of the University
of Manchester. Other articles which
should be consulted are <span class='sc'>Capillary Action</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 256), and <span class='sc'>Perpetual
Motion</span> (Vol. 21, p. 180).</p>

<h4 class='c016'>(<i>II</i>) <i>Sound</i></h4>

<p class='c017'>The main article <span class='sc'>Sound</span> (Vol. 25, p.
437) is by Prof. J. H. Poynting of the
University of Birmingham, and very
completely covers the subject; the reader
will, however, wish to refer to several
other articles for supplementary information.
Thus in the article <span class='sc'>Hearing</span> (Vol.
13, p. 124), the range of audibility is
discussed (see also <span class='sc'>Tartini</span>, Vol. 26, p.
436, for an account of Tartini’s tones),
while with regard to quality of tone the
reader will find suggestive matter under
<span class='sc'>Violin</span> (Vol. 28, p. 104). An account of
experiments in balloons on the propagation
of sound, will be found (Vol. 1, p.
267) under <span class='sc'>Aeronautics</span>. Reference
should also be made to the articles <span class='sc'>Wave</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 425), <span class='sc'>Elasticity</span>, <i>Vibrations
and Waves</i> (Vol. 9, p. 158), and <span class='sc'>Harmonic
Analysis</span> (Vol. 12, p. 956) for a
discussion of the form of sound waves.
For applications of the principles of sound
production, see also the articles <span class='sc'>Phonograph</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 467), <span class='sc'>Gramophone</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>(Vol. 12, p. 333), and especially <span class='sc'>Stringed
Instruments</span> (Vol. 25, p. 1038), <span class='sc'>Wind
Instruments</span> (Vol. 28, p. 709), and other
articles on musical instruments (see the
chapter on <i>Music</i> in this Guide). For
accounts of the researches of <span class='sc'>Kundt</span> (Vol.
15, p. 946), <span class='sc'>Lagrange</span> (Vol. 16, p. 75)
and <span class='sc'>Stokes</span> (Vol. 25, p. 951), see those
articles.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>(<i>III</i>) <i>Light</i></h4>

<p class='c017'>The main article <span class='sc'>Light</span> (Vol. 16, p.
608) is in four parts. The <i>Introductory</i>
and <i>Historical</i> sections are by C. Everitt;
that on the <i>Nature</i> of Light by Professor
Lorentz of the University of Leiden; that
on its <i>Velocity</i> by the late Simon Newcomb,
the eminent American astronomer.
The different phenomena connected with
the subject may conveniently be grouped
and studied as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(a) <span class='sc'>Colour</span> (Vol. 6, p. 728); Intensity,
see <span class='sc'>Photometry</span> (Vol. 21, p. 525), a brilliant
article by Prof. H. H. Turner, of
Oxford University; <span class='sc'>Illumination</span> (Vol.
14, p. 320).</p>

<p class='c007'>(g) <span class='sc'>Vision</span> (Vol. 28, p. 130).</p>

<p class='c007'>Far reaching developments are described
in <span class='sc'>Photography</span> (Vol. 21, p. 485)
and <span class='sc'>Spectroscopy</span> (Vol. 25, p. 619). In
the former article Sir W. de W. Abney
describes in great detail photographic
<i>Processes</i>; Major-General Waterhouse,
<i>Apparatus</i> and <i>Lenses</i>, while A. H. Hinton
discusses the <i>Pictorial</i> aspect of the
subject. There are also valuable articles
on <span class='sc'>Celestial Photography</span> (Vol. 21, p.
523), by Professor Turner, and on the
<span class='sc'>SpectroHeliograph</span> (Vol. 25, p. 618), by

<p class='c017'>The treatment of this subject in the
Encyclopaedia Britannica has been generally

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Historical</div>

<p class='c007'>We are so accustomed to think of electricity
as the peculiar possession of our
own age (the first crude attempts at an
electric light were only two score years ago)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>that we are apt to forget that the first
experiments in the
science were made at
least 2500 years ago.
The first effort to place it on a true
experimental and inductive basis dates
back more than three centuries to
the publication of the researches
of <span class='sc'>William Gilbert</span> (see Vol. 12,
p. 9), the most distinguished man of
science of his time, whom Queen Elizabeth
appointed her private physician at
the “usual” salary of £100. A hundred
years later, <span class='sc'>Volta</span> (Vol. 28, p. 198), who
might be called the patron saint of electricity,
produced the first electric current
with the pile which bears his name.
Meanwhile <span class='sc'>Benjamin Franklin</span> (Vol. 11,
p. 30) had been experimenting with his
famous kite, and <span class='sc'>Cavendish</span> (Vol. 5, p.
580) and <span class='sc'>Coulomb</span> (Vol. 7, p. 508) had
been paving the way for the startling developments
which resulted from Volta’s
invention. In the 19th century <span class='sc'>Faraday</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 173), <span class='sc'>Ampère</span> (Vol. 1, p.
878), <span class='sc'>Ohm</span> (Vol. 20, p. 34), <span class='sc'>Lord Kelvin</span>
(Vol. 15, p. 721), <span class='sc'>James Clerk Maxwell</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 929) and other brilliant
investigators in rapid succession developed
the field, until the science and application
of electricity have attained a
position absolutely dominating our daily
life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Analysis of the Subject</div>

<p class='c007'>The section of the Britannica treating
this great subject is therefore one of the
most important in the whole work, and
it was in the fullest recognition of the
fact that the editor asked Prof. J. A.
Fleming, of the University of London,
famous for his original work in both the
mathematical and the experimental
branches of the science, to organize the
sections for the new edition. The ground
is generally covered in the four articles, on
electricity, electrostatics, electrokinetics,
and electromagnetism, all contributed by
Prof. Fleming himself. The article
<span class='sc'>Electricity</span> (Vol. 9, p. 179) is the key
article to the subject, and should be read
first. The two great branches of electrical
theory then follow: (a) <span class='sc'>Electrostatics</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 240), in connection
with which the article <span class='sc'>Electrical Machine</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 176) should also be
studied, with reference to <span class='sc'>Electroscope</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 239) and <span class='sc'>Electrophorus</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 237). (b) <span class='sc'>Electrokinetics</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 210) and, supplementing
it, <span class='sc'>Conduction, Electric</span> (Vol.
6, p. 855). The latter is divided into
three parts: (i.) <i>Conduction in Solids</i>, by
Prof. Fleming; (ii.) <i>Conduction in Liquids</i>
by W. C. D. Whetham; (iii.) <i>Conduction
in Gases</i>, by Sir J. J. Thomson. In connection
with (ii.) should be read <span class='sc'>Electrolysis</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 217), by W. C.
D. Whetham, and with (iii.) <span class='sc'>Röntgen
Rays</span> (Vol. 23, p. 694) and <span class='sc'>Vacuum
Tube</span> (Vol. 27, p. 834), both by Sir J. J.
Thomson, whose article <span class='sc'>Electric Waves</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 203) is of fundamental importance.
The general principles of electrical
engineering are set out in the article
<span class='sc'>Electric Supply</span> (Vol. 9, p. 193)
with reference to <span class='sc'>Dynamo</span> (Vol. 8, p. 764);
<span class='sc'>Motors, Electric</span> (Vol. 18, p. 910);

(Vol. 26, p. 547).</p>

<p class='c007'>A bridge to <span class='sc'>Magnetism</span> (Vol. 17, p.
321), an article by Shelford Bidwell,
former president of the Physical Society,
is the article <span class='sc'>Electromagnetism</span> (Vol.
9, p. 226), by Prof. Fleming. This article
leads also to the study of manifestations
in nature of electricity and
magnetism: see the articles <span class='sc'>Atmospheric
Electricity</span> (Vol. 2, p. 860);
<span class='sc'>Aurora Polaris</span> (Vol. 2, p. 927);
<span class='sc'>Earth Currents</span> (Vol. 8, p. 813); and

was hot and dry; air, hot and wet; water,
cold and wet; earth, cold and dry. We
have outlived the belief in the philosopher’s
stone which animated the Middle
Ages. Yet these fallacies are but manifestations
of the effort—old as thought—to
reduce the manifoldness of matter to
primordial elements, from which, in one
form or other, every substance should
be capable of being built up. The ultimate
problem of chemistry is, therefore,
the constitution of matter, and the fight
around this is waged on the marches of the
physical and chemical sciences.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Triumphs of Chemistry</div>

<p class='c007'>The great commercial triumphs of
chemistry are, of course, those due to the
conquest of waste, to the utilization of
by-products which
for thousands of
years had been regarded
as useless.
We are all familiar with the uses to which
the by-products of coal-tar are put; we
swallow one derivative to relieve headache,
we may sugar our tea and flavour
our ice-cream with others; with one derivative
we clean our clothes which have
been dyed with others; and we disinfect
them with yet another. Phenacetin,
saccharin, synthetic vanilla, benzine,
naphthaline, analine dyes, carbolic acid,
are only a few of the many substances
won to the consumer by the chemist in
his laboratory; and this is only one field
of research. The chemist is always busy
(as now with rubber, camphor, etc.),
working at the synthesis of natural products
in the hope that he will be able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>find a means of manufacturing them in
quantities at a cost which will make
them, commercially possible, and thus
lessen the drain on the world’s natural
supply. In almost every detail of our
lives this science enters so familiarly that
we forget that the many things made
possible by the chemist do not simply
“happen,” but are the result of laborious
research in the laboratory.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not possible to attain proficiency
in any experimental science without laboratory
work; but to the student of
chemistry the lucid and original articles
in the Britannica will provide a most
useful commentary on his work with test-tube
and burner. The general reader will
find in these articles an admirable survey
of the subject, and of its bearings on
problems of daily life. The main article
<span class='sc'>Chemistry</span> (Vol. 6, p. 33) generally
covers the ground, and serves as an introduction
to separate articles on important
divisions of the subject. Following
its arrangement the scheme outlined

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Province Geology or Sermons in Stones</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>Shakespeare tells us that “there
are sermons in stones.” No science,
except possibly astronomy, appeals
more to the imagination or carries one
further away from our present workaday
world than geology. While geology
“claims as its peculiar territory the rocky
framework of the globe,” its object is,
says the Encyclopaedia Britannica (Vol.
11, p. 638) “to trace
the structural progress
of our planet
from the earliest beginnings
of its separate existence
through its various stages of growth
down to the present condition of things.”
It goes back millions and hundreds of
millions of years to the first beginnings
of things and unravels complicated processes
by which the earth and each of
the continents on it has been built up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It follows, even into detail, the varied
sculpture of mountain and valley, crag
and ravine.” It shows “that the present
races of plants and animals are the
descendants of other and very different
races which once peopled the earth. It
teaches that there has been a progressive
development of the inhabitants.” Dead
and cold though the rocks seem, they are
filled, to one who can read their secret,
with the tragedy of past life. Parts of
Florida are but the graves where millions
of corals, now crushed into massive
limestone, once lived and died; the coal
of Pennsylvania tells of ferns and other
terrestrial plants matted together into
a bed whence they originally grew; “the
snails and lizards which lived and died
within a hollow tree, the insects which
have been imprisoned within the exuding
resin of old forests, the footprints of
birds and quadrupeds, the trails of worms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>left upon former shores—these and innumerable
other pieces of evidence” tell
of the tragedies of former times and
“enable the geologist to realize in some
measure what the faunas and floras of
successive periods have been.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The foundation for the study of the
whole subject in the Britannica is the
article <span class='sc'>Geology</span> (Vol. 11, p. 638), equivalent
to 125 pages of this Guide. It is
by the highest authority in the world,
Sir Archibald Geikie, long director
general of the Geological Survey of
the United Kingdom, and director of the
Museum of Practical Geology, London. It
deals with the general principles and gives
an outline of the subject matter of the
science. In particular it treats of,</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The historical development of geological
science</i>;</p>

<ul class='index'>
  <li class='c018'><i>The cosmical aspects of geology</i>;</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Geognosy</i>;</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Dynamical Geology</i>;</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Geotectonic or Structural Geology</i>;</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Palaeontological Geology</i>;</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Stratigraphical Geology</i>;</li>
  <li class='c018'><i>Physiographical Geology</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class='sidenote'>Age of the Earth</div>

<p class='c007'>While the student will doubtless be
interested equally in each of these departments,
the general reader will be
especially interested in the
historical development
which—it is worthy of note—is
almost the only concise
account of geological history hitherto
published in English. Especially interesting
is the question, fully discussed,
of the age of the earth. Lord Kelvin
(Vol. 11, p. 653) declared some few years
ago that the time “was more than
twenty and less than forty millions of
years and probably much nearer twenty
than forty.” But the trend of later
investigations, and especially the study
of radio-activity, has led to the belief
that the period must have been much
longer. Sir Archibald Geikie sums up
the evidence as follows (Vol. 11, p. 653):
“In the present state of science it is out
of our power to state positively what
must be the lowest limit of the age of
the earth, but we cannot assume it to
be less, and it may possibly have been
much more than one hundred millions
of years.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Geological Formations</div>

<p class='c007'>The general reader will find of interest,
too, the table (Vol. 11, p. 670) representing
the geological record or order
of succession of the
formations of the
earth’s crusts from
the earliest Archean,
through Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian
and Carboniferous to the Post-glacial or
Human of to-day. A separate article is
to be found on each of these different
formations, namely: <span class='sc'>Archean</span> (Vol. 2,
p. 360); <span class='sc'>Cambrian</span> (Vol. 5, p. 86); <span class='sc'>Silurian</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 109); <span class='sc'>Devonian</span> (Vol.
8, p. 124); <span class='sc'>Carboniferous</span> (Vol. 5, p.
309); <span class='sc'>Permian</span> (Vol. 21, p. 176); <span class='sc'>Triassic</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 258); <span class='sc'>Jurassic</span> (Vol. 15,
p. 567); <span class='sc'>Cretaceous</span> (Vol. 7, p. 414);
<span class='sc'>Eocene</span> (Vol. 9, p. 661); <span class='sc'>Oligocene</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 81); <span class='sc'>Miocene</span> (Vol. 18, p.
565); <span class='sc'>Pliocene</span> (Vol. 21, p. 846); <span class='sc'>Pleistocene</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 835); Recent, Post-glacial
or Human under article <span class='sc'>Quaternary</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 718).</p>

<p class='c007'>Full local geological information is
found in geographical articles. See, for
instance, in the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>,
the section on <i>Geology</i> (Vol. 27, pp. 624–632),
by Professors R. D. Salisbury and
T. C. Chamberlin of the University
of Chicago; the section <i>Geology</i> in the
article <span class='sc'>England</span> (Vol. 9, pp. 415–416),
by H. R. Mill, editor of <i>The International
Geography</i>; the section <i>Geology</i> in the
article <span class='sc'>Africa</span> (Vol. 1, pp. 323–325), by
Walcot Gibson, author of <i>Mineral Wealth
of Africa</i>, etc. These special treatments
are accompanied by sketch maps. Similarly,
the articles on each of the different
states of the Union has a section giving
information on the geology, the flora
and fauna, the climate, and the geography
of the state. And in such articles
on geographic topics as <span class='sc'>Great Salt
Lake</span>, <span class='sc'>Niagara</span>, by G. Karl Gilbert,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>and <span class='sc'>Grand Canyon</span>, by R. S. Tarr,
there is valuable geological information.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other important articles which the
reader should consult are <span class='sc'>Petrology</span>
(Vol. 21, p 323), equivalent to 40 pages
of this Guide, largely illustrated, by Dr.
J. S. Fleet, petrographer to the Geological
Survey of Great Britain; <span class='sc'>Mineralogy</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 509), equivalent to
25 pages of this Guide, by L. J. Spencer,
editor of the <i>Mineralogical Magazine</i>;
<span class='sc'>Mineral Deposits</span> (Vol. 18, p. 504),
equivalent to 15 pages of this Guide,
by James F. Kemp, professor of geology
of Columbia University, and geologist
to the United States and New York
Geological Surveys; <span class='sc'>Crystallography</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 569), equivalent to 60 pages
of this Guide, also by L. J. Spencer;
<span class='sc'>Mining</span> (Vol. 18, p. 528), equivalent to
40 pages of this Guide, by Henry Smith
Munroe, professor of mining, Columbia
University, New York; <span class='sc'>Palaeontology</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 579), profusely illustrated,
equivalent to 35 pages of this Guide, by
Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn of Columbia
University, and president of the
American Museum of Natural History
of New York; <span class='sc'>Palaeobotany</span> (Vol. 20,
p. 524), profusely illustrated, equivalent
to 100 pages of this Guide, written by
three of the leading geological writers
of the day: Dr. D. H. Scott, president
of the Linnean Society, author of
<i>Studies in Fossil Botany</i>; A. E. Steward,
professor of botany of the University
of Cambridge; and Clement Reid, author
of <i>Fossil Flora of Tegelen</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of more popular interest are the three
articles, Earthquake, Seismometer and
Volcano. The article <span class='sc'>Earthquake</span> is in
two parts. The first (Vol. 8, p. 817)
is an historical account telling of the
extent and damage done by many earthquakes,
including the terrible San Francisco
earthquake of April 18, 1906, and
that of Calabria and Sicily, December 28,
1908, by F. W. Rudler, president of the
Geologists’ Association; the other part
(Vol. 8, p. 820), by Dr. J. Milne, late
professor of geology in the Imperial
University of Tokio, deals with the physical
theory of earthquakes. The article
<span class='sc'>Volcano</span> (Vol. 28, p. 178), equivalent
to 45 pages of this Guide, is by F. W.
Rudler, and gives us the reasons for and
the history of volcanic disturbances.
It is of interest both to the scholar and
to the casual reader. Thus we learn
that “while Herculaneum was buried
beneath a flood of mud swept down
from Vesuvius” in 79 A.D., Pompeii
“was overwhelmed in great measure by
loose ashes, capable of removal with
comparative ease.” Nearly everyone of
middle age remembers the famous eruption
of Krakatoa in 1883 and the famous
sunsets of that year. Concerning this
the Britannica article tells us (p. 180):</p>

<p class='c020'>Enormous quantities of dust ejected from
Krakatoa in 1883 were carried to prodigious
distances, samples having been collected at
more than a thousand miles from the volcano;
whilst the very fine material in ultramicroscopic
grains which remained suspended
for months in the higher regions of the
atmosphere seems to have enjoyed an almost
world-wide distribution, and to have been
responsible for the remarkable sunsets at
that period.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Dust</span> (Vol. 8, p. 713), by
John Aitken, inventor of the machine
for counting particles of dust, explains
the mechanical causes of this suspension.
Besides there is much concrete information
about volcanoes in articles on volcanic
regions: for instance, on volcanoes
in the possessions of the United States,
see articles <span class='sc'>Hawaii</span>, <span class='sc'>Alaska</span>, <span class='sc'>Philippines</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The student should read also the articles
on the different minerals, many of
them long and important and all by
well-known authorities. Thus the article
<span class='sc'>Diamond</span> (Vol. 8, p. 158), illustrated,
equivalent to 20 pages of this Guide,
is by Henry Alexander Miers, editor of
the <i>Mineralogical Magazine</i>. Besides
dealing with the general character of
this stone, the article pays particular
attention to diamond mining in South
Africa, the text being illustrated by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>plates showing the Kimberley and DeBeers
workings. The article <span class='sc'>Gem</span> (Vol.
11, p. 560), is equivalent to 25 pages of
this Guide. The article <span class='sc'>Gem, Artificial</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 569) is by the well-known
chemist and physicist, Sir William
Crookes. It tells of the changes
induced by radioactive emanations and
of the artificial production of the diamond,
ruby, sapphire, Oriental emerald,
amethyst and topaz. The reader will
be interested, too, in the article <span class='sc'>Lapidary
and Gem Cutting</span> (Vol. 16, p. 195),
by Dr. George F. Kunz, gem expert for
Messrs. Tiffany &#38; Co., New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are special biographical articles
in the Britannica on all the well-known
geologists, and in these articles special
stress has been laid on the part played
by the subject of the memoirs in promoting
the science. This is well shown,
for instance, in the articles <span class='sc'>Agassiz</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 367); <span class='sc'>Hutton</span> (Vol. 14, p. 16)
and <span class='sc'>Lyell</span> (Vol. 17, p. 158).</p>

<p class='c007'>Geology, by its study of earth deposits,
age of rocks, etc., and by its estimate
of the date of certain extinct animals
like the mammoth and hairy elephant,
or of the time when certain animals,
e.g., the elephant and reindeer, were
found in parts of the world where they
no longer occur, is an important adjunct
to the science of anthropology, especially
in the question of the antiquity of man.
On this see the section of antiquity of
man in the article <span class='sc'>Anthropology</span> (Vol.
2, p. 114), and, in general, the chapter
in this Guide on <i>Anthropology and
Ethnology</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>From one point of view geology is
only a branch of geography and the
student of geology should consult the
elaborate article on <span class='sc'>Geography</span> in the
Britannica, especially all parts dealing
with physical geography or physiography.
For a clue to this part of the book see
the chapter in this Guide on <i>Geography</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is a list of the more
important articles on Geology in the
Encyclopaedia Britannica:</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LVII<br> <span class='c014'>BIOLOGY<br> GENERAL AND INTRODUCTORY</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c034'>The Britannica tells us that Sir
Thomas Browne, the famous 17th
century physician and author,
once ventured to doubt “whether mice
may be bred by putrefaction,” and Alexander
Ross, the poet scientist of 200 years
ago, commenting on his scepticism wrote,
“So may he doubt whether in cheese and
timber worms are generated; or if beetles
and wasps in cows’ dung; or if butterflies,
locusts, grasshoppers, shell-fish, snails,
eels, and such like, be procreated of putrefied
matter, which is apt to receive the
form of that creature to which it is by
formative power disposed. To question
this is to question reason, sense and experience.
If he doubts of this let him go
to Egypt, and there he will find the fields
swarming with mice, begot of the mud of
Nylus, to the great calamity of the inhabitants”
(Vol. 1, p. 64). To-day science
gives no offhand answer to the question
of the origin of life. Abiogenesis, or
“spontaneous generation,” so-called, finds
a far less simple definition and research
still in vain bends its best energies to solving
this problem of problems.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject is so vast, dealing as it
does with all the phenomena manifested
by living matter, that in this Guide that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>branch of the subject which studies the
human organism is separately dealt with
in the chapter <i>Health and Disease</i>. This
chapter, therefore, is confined to the still
enormous subject of biology considered
as dealing with the general problem of
life; botany and zoology are treated in
the following chapters. The student of
either of the two last subjects should preface,
or at least supplement, his studies,
by reading the main general articles included
below.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Study of Life</div>

<p class='c007'>The guiding article <span class='sc'>Biology</span> (Vol. 3, p.
954), which should be read first, serves
as a key to the discussion of the biological
sciences. It is not
long, for the main
divisions of the subject
are treated more
conveniently and logically under their
own appropriate headings. P. Chalmers
Mitchell, secretary of the Zoological Society
of London, who organized the whole
subject for the new Britannica, is the
contributor. Supplementing this, the
article <span class='sc'>Life</span> (Vol. 16, p. 600), also by
Chalmers Mitchell, should be read, with
those on <span class='sc'>Protoplasm</span> (Vol. 22, p. 476),
<span class='sc'>Species</span> (Vol. 25, p. 616), <span class='sc'>Abiogenesis</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 64), <span class='sc'>Biogenesis</span> (Vol. 3, p.
952). In the two articles last named the
theory of spontaneous generation is examined
and found wanting, or at best
unproved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Structure</div>

<p class='c007'>Living matter may be regarded under
four aspects: structure, distribution, physiology,
evolution. For the first, the article
<span class='sc'>Morphology</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 863)
leads the discussion,
followed by <span class='sc'>Cytology</span> (Vol. 7, p. 710),
and <span class='sc'>Embryology</span> (Vol. 9, p. 314), in
which the growth of cell structures is discussed.
These articles are introductory to
the whole subject. Supplementing them
reference may be made to the Morphology
sections of the articles <span class='sc'>Plant</span> (Vol.
21, p. 728) and <span class='sc'>Zoology</span> (Vol. 28, p.
1022).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Distribution</div>

<p class='c007'>A most fascinating branch is that
which is concerned with the where and
when of the existence of organisms. The
articles in the Britannica
are worthy
of the interest of the
subject. Under <span class='sc'>Palaeontology</span> (Vol.
20, p. 579) H. F. Osborn, Columbia University,
New York, president of the
American Museum of Natural History,
New York, treats of the archaeology of
the biological sciences, of the extinct species
which once inhabited the earth;
while Clement Reid, of the Geological
Survey of Great Britain, A. C. Seward,
professor of botany, Cambridge University,
and Dr. D. H. Scott, president of
the Linnean Society, perform the same
service for plant life in the article <span class='sc'>Palaeobotany</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 524). The distribution
of present types is discussed
under <span class='sc'>Zoological Distribution</span> (Vol.
28, p. 1002), <span class='sc'>Plants</span>, <i>Distribution</i> (Vol.
21, p. 777), and <span class='sc'>Plankton</span> (Vol. 21, p.
720), in which Prof. G. H. Fowler of
University College, London, describes a
science which is still young—that of
tracing the drift and distribution of deep
sea life. See also <span class='sc'>Acclimatization</span> (Vol.
1, p. 114), by Alfred Russel Wallace and
Frank Finn, of the Indian Museum of
Calcutta.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Physiology</div>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LVIII<br> <span class='c014'>BOTANY</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>There are many gardeners and
lovers of gardens, but comparatively
few have even the most
elementary knowledge of botany. How
many, for instance, know or remember
that in the leaves of plants are situated
the kitchens in which they prepare their
food, or more than vaguely recognize the
presence of a nervous system in plant
organisms (Vol. 21, p. 747)? The majority,
indeed, ignore the fact that a little
study will add a hundred-fold to their
enjoyment, and that, unlike most scientific
subjects, botany can be studied with
a minimum of trouble or toil, and with
the simplest apparatus. His own garden,
the woods and fields, will give the inquirer
ample subjects for his investigations,
and, as in every other undertaking,
the longer he pursues it the more he will
see, and the more intense will be his
pleasure in the contemplation of the
garden of his cultivation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Botany is, of course, one branch of an
enormous subject. The student will,
therefore, do well to familiarize himself
with the general articles which cover the
science of living matter, as outlined in
the chapter on <i>Biology</i>. In that chapter
references have in fact already been
given to certain sections of the strictly
botanical articles. The general arrangement
of the subject in the Britannica is
as follows:—(i.) articles dealing with the
broad aspects of the science; (ii.) articles
on “systematic” botany treating of the
various families of plants; (iii.) articles
describing members of their families.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General Principles</div>

<p class='c007'>Following the most convenient and at
the same time the most logical course,
the article <span class='sc'>Botany</span> (Vol. 4, p. 299) gives
a key to the treatment
of the whole
subject in the Britannica.
This is by
A. B. Rendle, keeper of the Department
of Botany, British Museum, who acted
as general adviser to the editor in the arrangement
of this branch of biology in
the Britannica. The main article on the
subject is under the heading <span class='sc'>Plants</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 728), by a number of eminent
authorities. The article is divided as
follows: <i>Classification</i>, by A. B. Rendle;
<i>Anatomy and History and Bibliography</i>,
by A. G. Tansley, lecturer in botany in
the University of Cambridge; <i>Physiology</i>,
by J. R. Green, formerly lecturer on plant
physiology, University of Liverpool;
<i>Pathology</i>, by H. M. Ward, formerly professor
of botany, University of Cambridge;
<i>Ecology</i>, which comprises the
study of the relations of the individual
plant, or species, or the plant community,
with its habitat, by C. E. Moss, curator
of the Cambridge University Herbarium;
<i>Cytology</i>, which treats of the cell structure
of plant organisms, by H. W. T.
Wager, president of the Botanical section
of the British Association, 1905; <i>Morphology</i>,
by S. H. Vines, professor of
botany, University of Oxford, and president
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>of the Linnean Society, 1900–1904;
<i>Distribution</i>, by Sir W. T. Thiselton-Dyer,
director of the Kew Botanical Gardens.
Supplementary to the article <span class='sc'>Plants</span> are
the following, which should all be read
carefully: <span class='sc'>Root</span> (Vol. 23, p. 712), <span class='sc'>Stem</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 875), <span class='sc'>Leaf</span> (Vol. 16, p. 322),
<span class='sc'>Flower</span> (Vol. 10, p. 553), <span class='sc'>Fruit</span> (Vol. 11,
p. 254). A very important article is that
on <span class='sc'>Palaeobotany</span> (Vol. 20, p. 524),
which treats of the distribution, etc., of
plant life in prehistoric periods. The
contributor is Clement Reid of the
Geological Survey of England and Wales,
an original investigator in this important
field. The advances in the study of
minute plant organisms in the past few
years have been very great and they
receive treatment in the brilliant article
<span class='sc'>Bacteriology</span> (Vol. 3, p. 156), by Prof.
H. M. Ward of Cambridge University,
and V. H. Blackmann, professor of botany
in the University of Leeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other articles in the Britannica which
refer to the general principles of the science
will be found enumerated at the
end of this chapter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Divisions and Classification</div>

<p class='c007'>The student must, of course, make
himself familiar with the primary divisions
of the vegetable kingdom. These
are considered in order
below. By far
the biggest and the
most important is
that of the Angiosperms. They will be
treated first.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Angiosperms: Dicotyledons</div>

<p class='c007'>The division <span class='sc'>Angiosperms</span> (Vol. 2, p.
9) includes all those flowering plants
whose seeds are enclosed in capsules.
This division is again
divided into two
classes: the Dicotyledons
(Vol. 8, p.
185), which are distinguished by the
presence of a pair of seed-leaves or cotyledons
in the embryo contained in the
seed; and the Monocotyledons (see Vol.
2, p. 13), which contain only one. The
former embraces most of the flowerbearing
plants, and includes the following
families:—<span class='sc'>Boraginaceae</span> (Vol. 4, p. 242)
to which order belongs such plants as
forget-me-nots, borage, heliotrope, etc.
<span class='sc'>Caprifoliaceae</span> (Vol. 5, p. 290), which
include elder, honeysuckle, etc. <span class='sc'>Caryophyllaceae</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 439), with the
pinks, carnations, etc. <span class='sc'>Compositae</span> (Vol.
6, p. 811), which is the largest order in
this division and includes one-tenth of
the whole number of flowering plants,
with such varieties as lettuce, dandelion,
artichoke, sunflower, chrysanthemum,
etc. <span class='sc'>Convolvulaceae</span> (Vol. 7, p. 67),
among which are the convolvulus, sweet
potato, bindweed. <span class='sc'>Crassulaceae</span> (Vol.
7, p. 380), which include a quantity of
African plants. <span class='sc'>Cruciferae</span> (Vol. 7, p.
521), with the wallflower, stock, mustard,
cabbage, radish, nasturtium, etc. <span class='sc'>Cucurbitaceae</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 611), among
which are the cucumber, melon, etc.
<span class='sc'>Cupuliferae</span> (Vol. 7, p. 635), with the
hazel, oak, beech, alder. <span class='sc'>Ericaceae</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 739), with the rhododendron,
arbutus, whortleberry, heather. <span class='sc'>Euphorbiaceae</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 892), which include
the castor-oil plant, box, euphorbia, etc.
<span class='sc'>Gentianaceae</span> (Vol. 11, p. 601), with the
gentian, yellow-wort, bog-bean, etc. <span class='sc'>Geraniaceae</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 762), whose name
is derived from the geranium. <span class='sc'>Labiatae</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 3), with peppermint, marjoram,
thyme, sage, ground-ivy. <span class='sc'>Leguminosae</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 381), which embrace
gorse, furze, scarlet runner, mimosa,
acacia, rest-harrow, etc. <span class='sc'>Malvaceae</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 517), with the mallow, hibiscus,
hollyhock. The <span class='sc'>Moraceae</span> (Vol. 18,
p. 814), with the fig, mulberry, banyan,
etc. <span class='sc'>Onagraceae</span> (Vol. 20, p. 104), including
the evening primrose, fuschia,
etc. <span class='sc'>Polygonaceae</span> (Vol. 22, p. 26),
with dock, rhubarb, buckwheat, etc.
<span class='sc'>Primulaceae</span> (Vol. 22, p. 341), including
primrose, cowslip, pimpernel. <span class='sc'>Ranunculaceae</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 895), with the varieties
buttercup, clematis, aconite, larkspur,
columbine, marsh marigold, anemone.
<span class='sc'>Rosaceae</span> (Vol. 23, p. 722), to
which the rose gives the name, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>include strawberry, raspberry, apple,
pear, plum, spiraea, blackthorn, etc.
<span class='sc'>Rubiaceae</span> (Vol. 23, p. 808), with gardenias,

belong ivy, carrot, hemlock, celery, caraway,
parsley. <span class='sc'>Urticaceae</span> (Vol. 27, p.
805), which include the nettle tribes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Angiosperms: Monocotyledons</div>

<p class='c007'>The Monocotyledons include the <span class='sc'>Alismaceae</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 671), to which belong
the arrow-head, the water plantain, the
butomus (so called
because the leaves
cut the tongues of
oxen feeding on
them), and other water plants. <span class='sc'>Aroideae</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 640), so called from the Arum
family. The <span class='sc'>Bromeliaceae</span> (Vol. 4, p.
632), including pineapple, Spanish-moss.
<span class='sc'>Cyperaceae</span> (Vol. 7, p. 692), with bulrush,
cotton grass, etc. <span class='sc'>Grasses</span> (Vol.
12, p. 369), a most valuable article.
<span class='sc'>Hydrocharideae</span> (Vol. 14, p. 112), which
include a number of water plants. Iridaceae
(Vol. 14, p. 793), which include besides
the iris, the crocus, gladiolus, etc.
The <span class='sc'>Juncaceae</span> (Vol. 15, p. 555), or Rush
family; and the <span class='sc'>Liliaceae</span> (Vol. 16, p.
683), which include asparagus, hyacinth,
star of Bethlehem, fritillary, bluebell, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other Divisions</div>

<p class='c007'>Another big division is that of the
<span class='sc'>Gymnosperms</span> (Vol. 12, p. 754). These
have naked seed pods; that is to say, the
seeds are not enclosed
in capsules.
The best known and
largest division of
this class contains the conifers: pines,
firs, cedars, larches, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pteridophyta</span> (Vol. 22, p. 605), or
spore-producing plants, including the
fern families as the largest and most important
of its members.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bryophyta</span> (Vol. 4, p. 700), the second
great sub-division of the vegetable kingdom,
comprises the mosses and liverworts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Algae</span> (Vol. 1, p. 585), plants usually
devoid of differentiation into roots, stem,
and leaf, coming under the general class of
Bryophyta, and including sea-weeds as
the main group.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lichens</span> (Vol. 16, p. 578), compound
dual organisms, part algae and part fungus,
interesting because the dual organism
enables the plant to live where neither
of its compounds could live alone. Iceland
moss, valuable both for its nutritive
and medicinal qualities, comes under
this division.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Fungi</span> (Vol. 11, p. 333), an enormous
class, comprising, according to Saccardo,
32,000 different species.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bacteria (see <span class='sc'>Bacteriology</span>, Vol. 3, p.
156), minute organisms, also known as
microbes, bacilli, etc., technically called
Schizomycetes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Insectivorous Plants</span> (Vol. 14, p.
644), more correctly termed Carnivorous,
belong to a number of distinct natural
orders, but agree in the extraordinary
habit of adding to the supplies of nitrogenous
material offered them by the soil
and atmosphere by the capture and consumption
of insects and other small animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the main divisions, and from
the articles describing them the student
will acquire a sound knowledge of the
characteristics which distinguish each.
As a matter of fact, interest in botany as
a subject is first inspired by the particular
rather than the general—that is to say,
the love of individual flowers leads to the
study of their habits and life history,
thence to a comparison which leads to
the recognition of similar characteristics
in plants having apparently widely different
functions, so that the following
section of the subject, touching the
natural history of plants, though really
placed last in a logical course of reading
in botany, will contain much that is already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>known to the student who wishes
to pursue the subject systematically.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Natural History</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Britannica from the various
articles concerning the natural history of
individual plants it is easy to trace back
to what family and
main division each
plant belongs. To
the student beginning
the subject it will be most suggestive
to look up the accounts of the plants
which are cultivated in his garden, or
which he can find near his home, and
find out the family relationship between
subjects which appear to differ very
widely both in habits and characteristics.
From the outline given above in the paragraph
devoted to systematic botany an
indication will be given him of the surprises
which are in store for him as he
pursues his investigation. He would not
at first suspect, for example, that asparagus
and hyacinths were cousins, that
roses, apples, and blackthorn are closely
related, or that chrysanthemums and
artichokes have any connection with one
another, let alone cabbage and wallflowers.
An excellent scheme to arouse
the interest of the young student would
therefore be to encourage him to pick out
from the list below the names of plants
with which he is familiar and of which
he can get specimens, and thence work
backward until the meanings of the main
divisions of the vegetable kingdom are
clear to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the natural history section of the
following list will be found in alphabetical
order the plants which have separate articles
in the Britannica. Many plants
besides these are of course described.
They will be found in the Index, where
the volume and page on which a description
will be found are given.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LIX<br> <span class='c014'>ZOOLOGY</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>At the very outset of his zoological
studies the reader will find that
the doctors still differ as to the
best and most scientifically logical system
to be employed in classification. So
important is it that the connotation and
denotation of every zoological designation
should be definite, that Sir Edwin
Ray Lankester devotes the title article
<span class='sc'>Zoology</span> (Vol. 28, p. 1022) mainly to a
discussion of systems of classification,
and besides there is a separate article
<span class='sc'>Zoological Nomenclature</span> (Vol. 28, p.
1021) by P. Chalmers Mitchell, Secretary
of the Zoological Society of London, university
demonstrator in comparative
anatomy and assistant to the Linacre
Professor at Oxford, and adviser to the
editor in the organization of the whole
subject of zoology in the Britannica.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Britannica articles may be classified
in three divisions: dealing with
(i) <i>General Principles</i>, (ii) <i>Systematic</i>,
(iii) <i>Natural History</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General Principles</div>

<p class='c007'>The student should read at any rate
some of the general articles mentioned in
the chapter on <i>Biology</i>; and these will
prepare him for the difficult questions
involved in the articles
<span class='sc'>Zoology</span> and
<span class='sc'>Zoological Nomenclature</span>.
Supplementary
to these are the following:
<span class='sc'>Animal</span> (Vol. 2, p. 48), in connection
with which should be read the
article <span class='sc'>Protista</span> (Vol. 22, p. 476)
where the borderland between the animal
and vegetable kingdoms is further discussed,
and the very valuable article
<span class='sc'>Protozoa</span> (Vol. 22, p. 479) in which
E. A. Minchin, professor of protozoology
in the University of London, discusses
the minute animal organisms, which in
the last decade have proved immensely
important in the study of parasitic diseases.
In <span class='sc'>Larval Forms</span> (Vol. 16, p.
224), and <span class='sc'>Metamorphosis</span> (Vol. 18,
p. 221) Prof. Adam Sedgwick, of the
Imperial College of Science and Technology
in London, discusses the early
history of larvae and their change from
larval to adult growth. The articles
<span class='sc'>Metamerism</span> (Vol. 18, p. 215), by Sir
Edwin Ray Lankester, and <i>Regeneration
of Lost Parts</i> (Vol. 23, p. 36),
by P. Chalmers Mitchell, discuss the
capacity for repeating parts (as in the
case of the common earth worm) and for
the formation of new parts to take the
place of those lost by accident or injury.
The article <span class='sc'>Monster</span> (Vol. 18, p. 740)
by Dr. Charles Creighton will be found
very suggestive.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Protective Modifications</div>

<p class='c007'>The eyes of most of us are shut to
the wonders of the animal kingdom.
We know by hearsay that the colouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>of an animal or insect, brilliant and
startling though it
often be, is designed
by nature for protection
by enabling
it to assimilate itself to that of its surroundings.
But how many of us have
taken the trouble to verify this? The
articles <span class='sc'>Colours of Animals</span>, <i>Bionomics</i>
(Vol. 6, p. 731), by Prof. Poulton of
Oxford, and <span class='sc'>Mimicry</span> (Vol. 18, p. 495),
by R. I. Pocock, superintendent of the
Zoological Gardens in London, will suggest
to the reader many objects for
observation. Especially interesting in
the former article is the section on the
use of colour for warning and signaling.
In connection with these articles, those
on <span class='sc'>Egg</span> (Vol. 9, p. 13) and <span class='sc'>Feather</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 224), by W. P. Pycraft, of
the British Museum, may be read, and
<span class='sc'>Nidification</span> (Vol. 19, p. 666), by Prof.
Alfred Newton of Cambridge University,
and Hans Gadow, Strickland curator
and lecturer on zoology in the University
of Cambridge; especially those sections
concerned with the precautions
taken by the birds for protection and
concealment. A very fascinating subject
is discussed in the articles dealing
with the distribution and movements of
animal life. These are <span class='sc'>Zoological Distribution</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 1002), by the
well-known zoologist Richard Lydekker;
<span class='sc'>Migration</span> (Vol. 18, p. 433), by Hans
Gadow; and <span class='sc'>Plankton</span> (Vol. 21, p. 720),
by G. H. Fowler of University College,
London. Reference to these articles
has already been made in the chapter
on <i>Biology</i>. Closely connected with
them is the article on <span class='sc'>Palaeontology</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 579), by Prof. H. F. Osborn,
Columbia University and American Museum
of Natural History, in which the
distribution of prehistoric life is discussed;
and, as will be seen from the list below,
all the principal species now only found
in fossil remains are described in separate
articles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Intelligence of Animals</div>

<p class='c007'>The editor succeeded in getting the
psychologist, Prof. C. Lloyd Morgan,
of the University of Bristol, who has
made a specialty of
this particular subject,
to write extremely
illuminating
articles on <span class='sc'>Instinct</span> and on <span class='sc'>Intelligence
in Animals</span> (Vol. 14, pp. 648 and
680). Interesting as throwing a side
light on either the instinct or intelligence
of birds, is the section on their song in
the article <span class='sc'>Song</span> (Vol. 25, p. 413). It is
hardly possible to look through any of
these articles, or those on mimicry and
colour, above alluded to, without coming
across some striking and interesting fact,
as for instance, the sudden change from
a divine melody to an anxious croak in
the utterance of the male nightingale as
soon as the brood is hatched. These articles
will be read for their great interest by
many who do not intend systematically
to pursue the subject of Zoology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Animals in Captivity</div>

<p class='c007'>The housing of animals in captivity is
discussed in the articles <span class='sc'>Aquarium</span> (Vol.
2, p. 237), by Professor G. H. Fowler,
University College,
London; <span class='sc'>Aviary</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 60), by
D. Seth-Smith, curator
of birds to the Zoological Society
of London; and <span class='sc'>Zoological Gardens</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 1018), by P. Chalmers Mitchell.
The first two contain some very
useful hints for the care of small aquaria
and aviaries; and young people who like
to have aquaria at home, and are often
disappointed by their failure to keep
alive some of their specimens, especially
larval and other surface-swimming animals,
will find one of their difficulties
solved. These surface-swimming animals
die of exhaustion from their unaided
efforts to keep off the bottom, lacking
the support given in their surroundings
by the natural flow of the water, native
tides, and surface currents. The article
describes a very simple arrangement by
which this motion of the water can be
simulated.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Other articles which will be found
very interesting are those on <span class='sc'>Hibernation</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 441) and on <span class='sc'>Incubation
and Incubators</span> (Vol. 14, p. 359).
In the latter many will be surprised to
note that incubators have been in use
in Egypt from time immemorial under
the name <span class='sc'>Mamal</span>. In one district of
Egypt alone 90,000,000 eggs are annually
hatched out in these old time incubators,
of which the secret has been handed
down, jealously guarded, from father
to son. In the article <span class='sc'>Taxidermy</span> (Vol.
26, p. 464), Montagu Browne, a practical
taxidermist, deals with the artistic
as well as the technical aspects of the craft.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Classification and Divisions</div>

<p class='c007'>Turning to the articles of the chief
divisions of the animal kingdom, the most
useful arrangement will be to enumerate
them in their order.
As has been already
said, zoologists do
not yet agree as to
the best system of classification; the one
which is given in the Britannica is that
upon which the very eminent zoologists
who have contributed the special articles,
agree as being the most suitable. There
are two main grades. The <span class='sc'>Protozoa</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 479) contain the animalcules,
mainly microscopic. These are
the most elementary forms of life and
consist of single cells. The other and
more important grade is that of the
<span class='sc'>Metazoa</span>, which are built up of many cells.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Protozoa</div>

<p class='c007'>The main subdivisions (called phyla)
of the Protozoa are: phylum i. <span class='sc'>Sarcodina</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 208); phylum ii. <span class='sc'>Mastigophora</span>
(Vol. 17, p.
873); phylum iii.
<span class='sc'>Sporozoa</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 734); phylum iv. <span class='sc'>Infusoria</span> (Vol. 14,
557).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Metazoa</div>

<p class='c007'>Coming next, the Metazoa in their
order are, as follows: phylum i. Porifera
(see <span class='sc'>Sponges</span>, Vol. 25, p. 715); phylum ii.
<span class='sc'>Hydromedusae</span> or
<span class='sc'>Hydrozoa</span> (Vol. 14,
pp. 135 and 171)
which include aquatic animals of the
coral kind; phylum iii. <span class='sc'>Scyphomedusa</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 519) which include groups of
shell fish; phylum iv. <span class='sc'>Anthozoa</span> (Vol. 2,
p. 97) with the corals; phylum v. <span class='sc'>Ctenophora</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 592) including the
jelly fish; phylum vi. <span class='sc'>Platyelmia</span> (Vol.
21, p. 826) a group of animals in which
creeping first became habitual; phylum
vii. Nematoidea (see <span class='sc'>Nematoda</span>, Vol.
19, p. 359) which include certain kinds
of worms; phylum viii. <span class='sc'>Chaetognatha</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 789) an isolated class of
transparent pelagic organisms; phylum
ix. <span class='sc'>Nemertina</span> (Vol. 19, p.
363) worm families; phylum x. <span class='sc'>Mollusca</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 669) shell-bearing
animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phylum xi. <span class='sc'>Appendiculata</span> (Vol. 2,
p. 220) which include the sub-phyla
<span class='sc'>Rotifera</span> (Vol. 23, p. 759), <span class='sc'>Chaetopoda</span>
(Vol. 5, p. 789), and <span class='sc'>Arthropoda</span> (Vol.
2, p. 673), the sub-phylum which comprises
practically the whole insect family.
Important articles on animals in this
class are: <span class='sc'>Hexapoda</span> (Vol. 13, p. 418)
which include the wasp, beetle, and other
families; the <span class='sc'>Crustacea</span> (Vol. 7, p. 552)
which cover a field wide enough to
embrace species as different outwardly
as lobsters, wood-lice, and minute water
fleas; and <span class='sc'>Arachnida</span> (Vol. 2, p. 287)
the spider family. Phylum xii. <span class='sc'>Echinoderma</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 871) with all the sea-urchins
and star fish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phylum xiii. <span class='sc'>Vertebrata</span> (Vol. 27,
p. 1047) to which man belongs as an
order of a sub-class of a class of a sub-phylum.
The most important sub-phylum
of the Vertebrata is the Craniata
(see Vol. 27, p. 1048). The sub-phyla
<span class='sc'>Hemichorda</span> (Vol. 13, p. 257), Urochorda
(see <span class='sc'>Tunicata</span>, Vol. 27, p. 379), and
Cephalochorda (see <span class='sc'>Amphioxus</span>, Vol.
1, p. 886) deal with the lower orders of
Vertebrata. The sub-phylum Craniata
comprises the following classes: class i.
Pisces, see <span class='sc'>Ichthyology</span> (Vol. 14, p.
243) with the fishes; class ii. <span class='sc'>Batrachia</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 521), with the frog tribe;
class iii. Reptilia (see <span class='sc'>Reptiles</span>, Vol. 23,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>p. 136); and in close connection with
this—class iv. Aves (see <span class='sc'>Bird</span>, Vol. 3,
p. 959, and <span class='sc'>Ornithology</span>, Vol. 20, p.
299); class v. <span class='sc'>Mammalia</span> (Vol. 17, p. 520)
to which man belongs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phylum xiv. <span class='sc'>Mesozoa</span> (Vol. 18, p. 187)
minute parasitic animals intermediate
between the Protozoa and the Metazoa.
Phylum xv. <span class='sc'>Polyzoa</span> (Vol. 22, p. 42)
aquatic animals forming colonies by
budding. Phylum xvi. <span class='sc'>Acanthocephala</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 109) including the parasitic
worms. Phylum xvii. <span class='sc'>Podaxonia</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 1023), and phylum xviii.
<span class='sc'>Gastrotricha</span> (Vol. 11, p. 526) minute
animals living at the bottom of ponds
and marshes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Natural History</div>

<p class='c007'>This is an outline of the main division
of the animal kingdom in their order as
now classified. The subject of zoology
is so vast that the student will probably
confine himself to one branch of the
subject, perhaps to one small fraction
of a division, of
which he proposes to
investigate the complete
natural history.
As will be seen from the list below,
which is classified, the Britannica offers
an immense amount of material bearing
on the subject. But of course the study
of any one sub-class needs a general
knowledge of the foundations of zoological
science, so that some acquaintance
with the principles on which the animal
world is classified is indispensable. As
in Botany, it will be easy to see from
the article on any individual animal to
which family it belongs so that the young
student can work back from the particular
to the general and find out the whole
relationship of the subject in which he
is interested by reference to the “systematic”
article.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>Philosophers, says Plato, are
“those who are able to grasp the
eternal and immutable”; their pursuit
is wisdom. The history of philosophy
is, therefore, the history of the ideas
which have animated successive generations
of man; so that in the wide sense the
investigation includes all knowledge; the
natural as well as
the moral sciences;
and the Greeks, to
whom the western world owes the direction
of its thought, so understood it. The
several divisions of <span class='sc'>Philosophy</span> (Vol. 21,
p. 440), as we reckon them, were all fused
by Plato in a semi-religious synthesis,
with resulting confusion. Aristotle, the
encyclopaedist of the ancient world, saw
that the several issues should be regarded
as separate disciplines, and became the
founder of the sciences of logic, psychology,
ethics, and aesthetics. His “first
philosophy,” or, as we should say, “first
principles,” which stood as introductions
to his separate special inquiries, gradually
acquired the name metaphysics. In
more recent times the natural sciences:
biology, physics, chemistry, medicine,
etc., have been regarded as outside the
strict boundaries of the philosophic
schools; and theology, is excluded on the
ground that its subject matter is so extensive
that it may be looked upon as a
separate science. The main divisions of
philosophy are: <span class='sc'>Epistemology</span> (Vol. 9,
p. 701), which is concerned with the nature
and origin of knowledge, i. e., the possibility
of knowledge in the abstract; <span class='sc'>Metaphysics</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 224), the science of
being, often called <span class='sc'>Ontology</span> (Vol. 20,
p. 118), dealing, that is to say, with being
as being; and <span class='sc'>Psychology</span> (Vol. 22, p.
547), the science of mind, an analysis of
what “mind” means.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Some Important Articles and Their Writers</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Metaphysics and Logic</div>

<p class='c007'>It will be of interest to the reader if,
at this point, we enumerate some of the
more important articles in the Britannica
covering this
field with the names
of their authors. Andrew
Seth Pringle-Pattison,
professor of
logic and metaphysics in the University
of Edinburgh, wrote the general article
<span class='sc'>Philosophy</span>, which is a key to the whole
subject, as well as the articles <span class='sc'>Mysticism</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 123), <span class='sc'>Scepticism</span> (Vol.
24, p. 306), <span class='sc'>Scholasticism</span> (Vol. 24, p.
346), <span class='sc'>Spinoza</span> (Vol. 25, p. 687), and
others. Of fundamental importance is
the article <span class='sc'>Logic</span> (Vol. 16, p. 879), which
would occupy 124 pages of this Guide. It
is divided into two parts: the first, by
Thomas Case, president of Corpus Christi
College, Oxford, formerly professor of
moral and metaphysical philosophy in
that university, treats of the science generally,
and examines in detail the processes
of inference. The second, by H.
W. Blunt, of Christ
Church, Oxford, and
formerly fellow of All
Soul’s, gives a brilliant
account of the <i>history</i> of logic, that
is, the history of the ideas which have
been the basis of all attempts to regulate
these processes of inference. This account
is unique in that it is the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>critical review of the types of logical
theory that has been attempted. A lucid
discussion of a most difficult subject
is that given under <span class='sc'>Metaphysics</span> (Vol.
18, p. 224); equivalent to 100 pages in
this Guide by Professor Case, to whom,
as one of the most distinguished of
modern Aristotelians, the article <span class='sc'>Aristotle</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 501) was also assigned.
The life and work of <span class='sc'>Plato</span> are examined
in a valuable article (Vol. 21, p. 808), the
equivalent in length to 54 pages of
this Guide, by the late Professor
Lewis Campbell, of St. Andrews, one
of the best known Platonists of the
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry Sturt, author of <i>Personal Idealism</i>
and many other books, is responsible
for brilliant discussions of <span class='sc'>Utilitarianism</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 820), <span class='sc'>Nominalism</span> (Vol.
19, p. 735), <span class='sc'>Metempsychosis</span> (Vol. 18,
p. 259), <span class='sc'>Space and Time</span> (Vol. 25, p.
525), etc. And F. C. S. Schiller, of
Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who,
under the wider, and historically more
significant title “Humanism,” has further
developed the pragmatic philosophy of
William James, contributed the articles
on <span class='sc'>Pragmatism</span>, <span class='sc'>Herbert Spencer</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Nietzsche</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Psychology</div>

<p class='c007'>The very important article on <span class='sc'>Psychology</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 54), equal to nearly
200 pages of this Guide was contributed
by James Ward,
professor of mental
philosophy, Cambridge,
who has devoted his whole
life to psychological research. In addition
to <span class='sc'>Psychology</span> he also contributed
the articles <span class='sc'>Herbart</span> (Vol. 13,
p. 335), and <span class='sc'>Naturalism</span> (Vol. 19, p. 274).
James Sully, the well-known psychologist,
former professor of the philosophy
of the mind and logic, at University College,
London, contributes the article
<span class='sc'>Aesthetics</span> (Vol. 1, p. 277). The article
<span class='sc'>Ethics</span> (Vol. 8, p. 808), equivalent to
about 100 pages of this Guide, and <span class='sc'>Will</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 648), both of primary importance,
were the work of the Rev. H.
H. Williams, lecturer in philosophy, Hertford
College, Oxford.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very interesting articles are <span class='sc'>Association
of Ideas</span> (Vol. 2, p. 784), <span class='sc'>Dream</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 588), <span class='sc'>Instinct</span> (Vol. 14, p. 648)
and, very important, <span class='sc'>Weber’s Law</span> (Vol.
28, p. 458), which expresses the relation
between sensation and the stimulus which
induces it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of recent years the psychology of
crowds has received a good deal of attention;
in fact, the need of an understanding
of the phenomena attending it is of
increasing importance in this age of universal
suffrage. Interesting light is
thrown upon the subject in the articles
<span class='sc'>Suggestion</span> (Vol. 26, p. 48), by W. M.
McDougall, Wilde reader in mental philosophy
at Oxford; <span class='sc'>Imitation</span> (Vol. 14,
p. 332); and <span class='sc'>Religion</span> (Vol. 23, p. 66).
A line of inquiry of vital importance to
the social body is examined in the articles
<span class='sc'>Criminology</span> (Vol. 7, p. 464), by
Major Griffith, for many years H. M. Inspector
of Prisons, in which Lombroso’s
theory of the possession by criminals of
special anatomical and physiological
characteristics is criticized, and the problem
is shown to be one of abnormal psychology;
see also <span class='sc'>Cesare Lombroso</span> (Vol.
16, p. 936). For discussions of other
forms of abnormal psychology, see the
chapter <i>For Physicians and Surgeons</i> in
this Guide, and in particular the article
<span class='sc'>Insanity</span> (Vol. 14, p. 597).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Psychical Research</div>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps more popular, certainly more
sensational, than the more legitimate
branches of psychology, is that classed
under <span class='sc'>Psychical
Research</span> (Vol. 22,
p. 544). The title
article was written
by Andrew Lang, who wrote <span class='sc'>Poltergeist</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 14), as well as articles
on <span class='sc'>Second Sight</span> (Vol. 24, p. 570), <span class='sc'>Apparitions</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 209), etc. The article
<span class='sc'>Divination</span> (Vol. 8, p. 332) was
written by Northcote Thomas, government
anthropologist to Southern Nigeria,
and author of <i>Thought Transference</i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>other books; and Mrs. Henry Sidgwick,
formerly principal of Newnham College,
Cambridge, and secretary to the Society
for Psychical Research, was responsible
for the article <span class='sc'>Spiritualism</span> (Vol. 25, p.
705). Among the biographical articles in
this section, interest will be felt in the
biography of Daniel Dunglas <span class='sc'>Home</span>, the
original of Robert Browning’s poem,
“Sludge the Medium.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Classification</div>

<p class='c007'>We now may classify the principal subjects
belonging to the main divisions
of philosophy, the sciences of epistemology,
metaphysics, and
psychology. The wider
phases of thought
roughly belonging to the division of metaphysics
are, in their historical order:
Platonism (see <span class='sc'>Plato</span>, Vol. 21, p. 808),
and Aristotelianism (see <span class='sc'>Aristotle</span>, Vol.
2, p. 501), the two great Greek systems
of the classical period; <span class='sc'>Neoplatonism</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 372), the last school of pagan
philosophy, which grew up mainly among
the Greeks of Alexandria from the 3rd
century A.D. onwards; <span class='sc'>Scholasticism</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 346), which gave expression
to the most typical products of medieval
thought; <span class='sc'>Idealism</span> (Vol. 14, p. 281), the
philosophy of the “absolute,” which,
though it has given a tinge to philosophic
thought from the days of Socrates to the
present time, is in its self-conscious form
a modern doctrine; <span class='sc'>Materialism</span> (Vol.
17, p. 878), which regards all the facts of
the universe as explainable in terms of
matter and motion; <span class='sc'>Realism</span> (Vol. 22, p.
941), which is a sort of half-way house
between Idealism and Materialism; <span class='sc'>Pragmatism</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 246), the philosophy
of the “real,” which expresses the reaction
against the intellectualistic speculation
that has characterized most of modern
metaphysics. <span class='sc'>Logic</span> (Vol. 16, p. 879),
the art of reasoning, or, as Ueberweg expresses
it, “the science of the regulative
laws of thought,” clearly belongs to the
division of epistemology. Aspects of psychology,
since they depend essentially
upon perceptions of the human mind in
relation to itself or its environment, are
<span class='sc'>Ethics</span> (Vol. 9, p. 808), or moral philosophy,
the investigation of theories of good
and evil; and <span class='sc'>Aesthetics</span> (Vol. 1, p.
277), the philosophy or science of the
beautiful, of taste, or of the fine arts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>History of Thought Personal</div>

<p class='c007'>The articles enumerated will give the
reader a clear idea of the drift of thought
currents throughout the course of history,
and they will
introduce him to the
detailed discussions
of the various systems
which have
been propounded by the little band of men
who have contributed something vital to
the treasury of thought. Each has been
in and out of fashion at different times.
In the Britannica the contributions to
philosophic thought by the great philosophers
are discussed in biographical articles,
to which we now turn.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Breaking the Ground</div>

<p class='c007'>The father of Greek philosophy and
indeed of European thought was <span class='sc'>Thales</span>
of Miletus (Vol. 26, p. 720), who founded
the <span class='sc'>Ionian School</span>
(Vol. 14, p. 731) at
the end of the 7th
century B.C. He
first, as far as we know, sought to go behind
the infinite multiplicity of phenomena
in the hope of finding an all embracing
infinite unity. This unity he decided
was water. <span class='sc'>Heraclitus</span> (Vol. 13, p.
309), the “dark philosopher,” nicknamed
from his aristocratic prejudices “he who
rails at the people,” later selected fire.
The never ending fight between advocates
of the “One” and the “Many” had
therefore begun. Sophistry (see <span class='sc'>Sophists</span>,
Vol. 25, p. 418) has now an unpleasant
connotation, inherited from the
undisciplined reasonings of the schools of
which <span class='sc'>Protagoras</span> (Vol. 22, p. 464),
<span class='sc'>Gorgias</span> (Vol. 12, p. 257), <span class='sc'>Parmenides</span>
of Elea (Vol. 20, p. 851), and <span class='sc'>Zeno</span>, also
of Elea (Vol. 28, p. 970), were leaders.
The “science of the regulative laws of
thought” had not yet been developed and
fallacies were the rule rather than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>exception. Protagoras, the first of the
Sophists, in his celebrated essay on
Truth, said that “Man is the measure of
all things, of what is, that it is, and what is
not, that it is not.” In other words, there is
no such thing as objective truth. After
nineteen-hundred years we are still seeking
the answer to Pilate’s question, “What
is truth?” Gorgias, in his equally famous
work on Nature or on the Nonent (notbeing)
maintained that “(a) nothing is,
(b) that, if anything is, it cannot be
known, (c) that, if anything is and can
be known, it cannot be expressed in
speech.” The paradoxes with which
Zeno, the pupil and friend of Parmenides,
adorned his arguments are proverbial.
Who has not heard of Achilles and the
tortoise? And it is a little curious that
in quite modern times his sophisms have,
after centuries of scornful neglect, been
reinstated and made the basis of a mathematical
renaissance by the German professor
Weierstrass, who shows that we
live in an unchanging world, and that
the arrow, as Zeno paradoxically contended,
is truly at rest at every moment
of its flight (Vol. 28, p. 971).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Socratic Schools</div>

<p class='c007'>The teaching of <span class='sc'>Socrates</span> (Vol. 25, p.
331) was oral, and his philosophy is
handed down to us in the refined and
elaborated system
which <span class='sc'>Plato</span> (Vol.
21, p. 808) developed
in his dialogues. The
“One” and the “Many” were united
in the philosophy of Plato. To him
we owe a debt which is simply incalculable,
for, as is shown in the Britannica,
“to whatever system of modern
thought the student is inclined he will
find his account in returning to this wellspring
of European thought, in which all
previous movements are absorbed, and
from which all subsequent lines of reflection
may be said to diverge.” The germs
of all ideas, even of most Christian ones,
are, as Jowett remarked, to be found in
Plato. The teaching of Socrates bore
fruit in strangely divers forms. Plato,
his legitimate successor, and the expounder
of his philosophy, has been referred
to, but there were other very different
developments. The <span class='sc'>Cynics</span> (Vol.
7, p. 691), of whom <span class='sc'>Diogenes</span> (Vol. 8, p.
281) is the notorious prototype, uncouthly
preached the asceticism which
was to become so fashionable in a later
era; but, their central doctrine, “let man
gain wisdom—or buy a rope,” contains
more than a germ of truth. The <span class='sc'>Cyrenaics</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 703), under <span class='sc'>Aristippus</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 497), starting from the two
Socratic principles of virtue and happiness,
differed from the Cynics in emphasizing
the second. The <span class='sc'>Megarians</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 77), the “friends of ideas,”
as Plato called them, united the Socratic
principles of virtue (as the source
of knowledge) with the Eleatic doctrine
(Vol. 9, p. 168) of the “One” as opposed
to the “Many.” Their strength
lay in the intellectual pre-eminence of
their members, not so much in the doctrine,
or combination of doctrines, which
they inculcated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Aristotle</div>

<p class='c007'>Plato had done much, he had laid the
foundation of modern thought; it remained
to classify it and to systematize
it. This task was
reserved for <span class='sc'>Aristotle</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 501),
one of the greatest geniuses of any age.
He invented the sciences of logic, ethics,
aesthetics, and psychology, as separate
sciences. He was at once a student, a
reader, a lecturer, a writer, and a book
collector. He was the first man whom
we know to have collected books, and he
was employed at one time by the kings of
Egypt as consulting librarian. His system
of aesthetics still remains the best
foundation of the critic’s training. The
fundamental difference between Aristotle
and Plato is that Platonism is a
philosophy of universal forms, and Aristotelianism
one of individual substances.
As Professor Case puts it in the
Britannica: “Plato makes us think
first of the supernatural and the kingdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>of heaven, Aristotle of the natural and the
whole world.” His inquiries, therefore,
pre-eminently implied that “transvaluation
of all values,” of which Nietzsche
was to boast more than two thousand
years later. A contemporary of Aristotle,
whose philosophy occupies a
somewhat independent position, is <span class='sc'>Epicurus</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 683). His advice to a
young disciple was to “steer clear of culture.”
His system, in fact, led him to
go back from words to realities in order
to find in nature a more enduring and a
wider foundation for ethical doctrine;
“to give up reasonings, and get at feelings,
to test conceptions and arguments
by a final reference to the only touchstone
of truth—the senses.” A famous
Roman who subscribed to the doctrines
of Epicurus was the poet-philosopher-scientist,
<span class='sc'>Lucretius</span> (Vol. 17, p. 107),
whose theories in his poem <i>De Rerum
Natura</i> so curiously anticipated much of
modern physics and psychology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Last Greek Schools</div>

<p class='c007'>Two schools remain to be considered
before the Greek philosophy can be dismissed:
the <span class='sc'>Stoics</span> (Vol. 25, p. 942) and
the Neoplatonists
(see <span class='sc'>Neoplatonism</span>,
Vol. 19, p. 372).
The Stoics caught
the practical spirit of the age which had
been evoked by Aristotle and provided a
popular philosophy to meet individual
needs. They showed kinship with the
Cynics, but under the inspiration of
their founder, Zeno of Citium, they
avoided the excesses of that school, and
formulated a system which fired the
imagination of the time and finally bequeathed
to Rome the guiding principles
which were to raise her to greatness.
Zeno is regarded as the best exponent of
anarchistic philosophy in ancient Greece,
and he and his philosophers opposed the
conception of a free community without
government to the state-Utopia of Plato;
see <span class='sc'>Anarchism</span> (Vol. 1, p. 915). Of Neoplatonism
Adolph Harnack says in the
Britannica (Vol. 19, p. 372):</p>

<p class='c020'>Judged from the standpoint of empirical
science, philosophy passed its meridian in
Plato and Aristotle, declined in the postAristotelian
systems, and set in the darkness
of Neoplatonism. But, from the religious
and moral point of view, it must be
admitted that the ethical “mood” which
Neoplatonism endeavored to create and
maintain is the highest and purest ever
reached by antiquity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most famous exponents of this system
were <span class='sc'>Plotinus</span> (Vol. 21, p. 849), an
introspective mystic, and <span class='sc'>Porphyry</span> (Vol.
22, p. 103), who edited Plotinus’s works
and wrote his biography. Neoplatonism,
coming as it did early in our era, formed
a link between the pagan philosophy of
ancient Greece and Christianity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Medieval Ecclesiasticism</div>

<p class='c007'>With the death of <span class='sc'>Boetius</span> (Vol. 4, p.
116), in 524 A.D.,
and with the closing
of the philosophical
schools in Athens
five years later, intellectual darkness settled
over Europe and hung there for centuries.
When in the Middle Ages, the
speculative sciences once again attracted
men’s minds, Christianity had already
impressed its mark. <span class='sc'>Scholasticism</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 346) as a system began with
the teaching of <span class='sc'>Scotus Erigena</span> (Vol. 9,
p. 742) at the end of the 9th century, and
culminated three centuries later with
<span class='sc'>Albertus Magnus</span> (Vol. 1, p. 504), with
his greater disciple <span class='sc'>Thomas Aquinas</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 250), whose ideas have animated
orthodox philosophic thought in
the Catholic Church to this day, and with
<span class='sc'>Meister Eckhart</span> (Vol. 8, p. 886), the
first of the great speculative mystics (see
<span class='sc'>Mysticism</span>, Vol. 19, p. 123).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Modern Ideas</div>

<p class='c007'>With the Reformation an assertion of
independence made itself heard. Man’s
relation to man assumed an importance
comparable to that
of his relation to
God; and the first
steps on the path which was to lead to the
rationalism of the French Encyclopaedists
and of the English Utilitarians were
taken by Albericus <span class='sc'>Gentilis</span> (Vol. 11, p.
603), and Hugo <span class='sc'>Grotius</span> (Vol. 12, p. 621).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>In England, <span class='sc'>Francis Bacon</span> (Vol. 3,
p. 135) was independently working out
the same problems. In philosophy his
position was that of a humanist. The
remarkable success of Grotius’s treatise
<i>De Jure Belli et Pacis</i> brought his views
of natural right into great prominence,
and suggested such questions as: “What
is man’s ultimate reason for obeying laws?
Wherein exactly does their agreement
with his rational and social nature exist?
How far and in what sense is his nature
really social?” The answers which
<span class='sc'>Hobbes</span> (Vol. 13, p. 545), who was
considerably influenced by Bacon, gave
to these fundamental questions in his
<i>Leviathan</i> marked the starting point of
independent ethical inquiry in England.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Utilitarians<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
From this time on
the drift of thought
in England, though
of course often profoundly affected by
the speculations of continental philosophers,
mainly ran in utilitarian channels;
and the succession of ideas may be traced
through <span class='sc'>Locke</span> (Vol. 16, p. 844), whose
influence on the French Encyclopaedists
was far reaching, <span class='sc'>Hume</span> (Vol. 13, p. 876),
Jeremy <span class='sc'>Bentham</span> (Vol. 3, p. 747) with
his famous principle of the “greatest happiness
for the greatest number,” J. S.
<span class='sc'>Mill</span> (Vol. 18, p. 454), and Herbert
<span class='sc'>Spencer</span> (Vol. 24, p. 634), with his philosophy
of the “unknowable.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Back to Dreams</div>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, on the continent of Europe,
<span class='sc'>Descartes</span> (Vol. 7, p. 79), in the
<i>Discourse of Method</i>, had stated his famous
proposition “<i>Cogito,
ergo sum</i>,” and had laid
down those fundamental
dogmas of logic, metaphysics, and
physics, from which started the subsequent
inquiries of <span class='sc'>Locke</span>, <span class='sc'>Leibnitz</span> (Vol.
16, p. 385), and <span class='sc'>Newton</span> (Vol. 19, p. 583).
But <span class='sc'>Cartesianism</span> (Vol. 5, p. 414), as
Dr. Caird points out in the Britannica,
includes not only the work of Descartes,
but also that of <span class='sc'>Malebranche</span> (Vol. 17, p.
486) and of <span class='sc'>Spinoza</span> (Vol. 25, p. 687), who,
from very different points of view, developed
the Cartesian theories, the former
saturated with the study of Augustine,
the latter with that of Jewish philosophy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Rights of Man</div>

<p class='c007'>There follows a group of men whose
speculations left a deep mark on the
course of events in Europe and America:
<span class='sc'>Voltaire</span> (Vol. 28,
p. 199), <span class='sc'>Montesquieu</span>
(Vol. 18, p.
775), Jean Jacques
<span class='sc'>Rousseau</span> (Vol. 23, p. 775), and Denis
<span class='sc'>Diderot</span> (Vol. 8, p. 204). The antiecclesiastical
animus which informed the
writings of the first, the <i>Esprit des Lois</i>
of the second, the <i>Contrat Social</i> of the
third, and the famous encyclopaedia of
the last, had political results, but their
influence on metaphysical inquiry was
practically nil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Transcendentalism</div>

<p class='c007'>Outstanding, of course, in the 18th
century was the influence of Immanuel
<span class='sc'>Kant</span> (Vol. 15, p. 662), who summed up
the teachings of
Leibnitz and Hume,
carried them to their
logical issues, and
immensely extended them. In fact,
Kant and his disciple <span class='sc'>Fichte</span> (Vol. 10, p.
313), as Prof. Case shows in the article
<span class='sc'>Metaphysics</span> (Vol. 18, p. 231), “became
the most potent philosophic influences on
European thought in the 19th century,
because their emphasis was on man.”
They made man believe in himself and
in his mission. They fostered liberty and
reform, and even radicalism. They almost
avenged man on the astronomers,
who had shown that the world is not
made for earth, and therefore not for
man. Kant half asserted, and Fichte
wholly, that Nature is man’s own construction.
The <i>Kritik</i> and the <i>Wissenschaftslehre</i>
belonged to the revolutionary
epoch of the “Rights of Man,” and produced
as great a revolution in thought as
the French Revolution did in fact. Instead
of the old belief that God made the
world for man, philosophers began to
fall into the pleasing dream “I am everything,
and everything is I”—and even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>“I am God.” The term <span class='sc'>Transcendentalism</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 172) has been specially
applied to the philosophy of Kant and
his successors, which is based on the view
that true knowledge is intuitive, or supernatural.
The famous Transcendental
Club founded, 1836, by <span class='sc'>Emerson</span> (Vol.
9, p. 332) and others in New England,
was not “transcendental” in the Kantian
sense; its main theme was regeneration,
a revolt from theological formalism, and
a wider literary outlook; see also <span class='sc'>Brook
Farm</span> (Vol. 4, p. 645), <span class='sc'>Thoreau</span> (Vol. 26,
p. 877), <span class='sc'>A. Bronson Alcott</span> (Vol. 1, p.
528), and <span class='sc'>Margaret Fuller</span> (Vol. 11,
p. 295).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Idealism</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Schelling’s</span> position (Vol. 24, p. 316),
like that of his disciple <span class='sc'>Hegel</span> (Vol. 13,
p. 200), differed from the transcendentalism
of Kant and
Fichte in regarding
all noumena, or
things comprehended (Vol. 19, p. 828),
as knowable products of universal reason—the
Absolute Ego, and, the absolute
being God, nature as a product of universal
reason, “a direct manifestation
not of man but of God.” This was the
starting point of noumenal idealism in
Germany, and showed a reversion to the
wider opinions of Aristotle. Hegelianism
in which this idealism is carried to its
limit is professedly one of the most
difficult of philosophies. Hegel said
“One man has understood me and even
he has not.” His obscurity lies in
the manner in which, as William Wallace
shows in his article on the philosopher
(Vol. 13, p. 204), he “abruptly hurls us
into worlds where old habits of thought
fail us.” The influence of Hegel on
English thought has been wide and
lasting.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Realism</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Schopenhauer</span> (Vol. 24, p. 372) was
essentially a realist. He led the inevitable
reaction against the absorption of
everything in reason which
is the keynote of the Kantian
system. In the very
title of his chief work, <i>The World as
Will and Idea</i>, he emphasizes his position
in giving “will” equal weight with “mind”
or “idea” (<i>Vorstellung</i>). His “Will to Live”
embodies a wholesome practical idea.
Eduard von <span class='sc'>Hartmann</span> (Vol. 13, p. 36) in
his sensational <i>Philosophy of the Unconscious</i>
established the thesis: “When the
greater part of the Will in existence is
so far enlightened by reason as to perceive
the inevitable misery of existence,
a collective effort to will non-existence
will be made, and the world will relapse
into nothingness, the Unconscious into
quiescence.” He thus goes a step further
in pessimism than did Schopenhauer,
and the essence of his doctrine is the will
to non-existence—<i>not</i> to live, instead of
a will to live. German realism is,
however, so strongly coloured by the
idealistic cast of the national thought
that we have to go to France and England
for the most thorough-going statement
of the realist position. In France
the eclecticism of <span class='sc'>V. Cousin</span> (Vol. 7, p.
330) marked a doctrine of comprehension
and toleration, opposed to the
arrogance of absolutism and to the dogmatism
of sensationalism which were the
tendencies of his day. In England a
reversion to Baconian ideas produced
the natural or intuitive realism of <span class='sc'>Reid</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 51), <span class='sc'>Dugald Stewart</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 913), <span class='sc'>Sir William Hamilton</span>
(Vol. 12, p. 888) and their followers,
and led to the synthetic philosophy
of <span class='sc'>Herbert Spencer</span> (Vol. 25, p.
634).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Materialism</div>

<p class='c007'>The materialists go a step further than
the realists. In its modern sense materialism
is the view that all we know is
body (or matter), of
which the mind is
an attribute or
function. This attitude was induced
by the rapid advances of the natural
sciences, and by the unifying doctrine of
gradual evolution in nature. It was
also heralded by a remarkable growth
in commerce, manufactures, and industrialism.
The leaders of the movement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>were <span class='sc'>Büchner</span> (Vol. 4, p. 719) whose
<i>Kraft und Stoff</i> became a text book of
materialism, and <span class='sc'>Haeckel</span> (Vol. 12, p. 803)
who in his <i>Riddle of the Universe</i> asserts
that, sensations being an inherent property
of all substance, neither mind nor
soul can have an origin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The 19th Century and Beyond</div>

<p class='c007'>In the inquiries of <span class='sc'>Lotze</span> (Vol. 17, p. 23),
and <span class='sc'>Fechner</span> (Vol. 10, p. 231), the latter
an experimental psychologist, lies the
germ of much of the
speculative thought
of the present day.
Lotze, as the well-known
psychologist
Henry Sturt says in his article in the
Britannica (Vol. 17, p. 25), “brought
philosophy out of the lecture room into
the market place of life.” He saw that
metaphysics must be the foundation
of psychology, and that the current
idealist theories of the origin of knowledge
were unsound; and he concluded that
the union of the regions of facts, of laws,
and of standards of values, can only
become intelligible through the idea of
a personal deity. Like a brilliant meteor
<span class='sc'>Nietzsche</span> (Vol. 19, p. 672) flashed
across the philosophic sky. His theories
of the super-man are known to everyone.
His brilliant essays are all in the nature
of prolegomena to a philosophy which,
embodied in a master work, the “Will
to Power,” was to contain a transvaluation
of all existing ethical values. Unfortunately
he did not live to complete
the work, which remains a fragment;
but the drift of his thought is clearly
indicated. One other system should
be mentioned, that of <span class='sc'>Positivism</span> (Vol.
22, p. 172), which its founder, <span class='sc'>Auguste
Comte</span> (Vol. 6, p. 814) hoped would
supersede every other system. Comte’s
philosophy confines itself to the data
of experience and declines to recognise
a priori or metaphysical speculations.
The system of morality which he built
up on it, and in which God is replaced
by Humanity, has largely failed, in spite
of the brilliant ideas which animate it,
because it is in many of its aspects
retrograde. A most interesting review
of present day tendencies in the regions
of Metaphysics will be found at the end
of that article, with special reference to
the brilliant work of <span class='sc'>Wundt</span> (see also
Vol. 28, p. 855), who constructing his
system on the Kantian order—sense,
understanding, reason, exhibits most
clearly the necessary consequence from
psychological to metaphysical idealism.
His philosophy is the best exposition
of modern idealism—that we perceive
the mental and, therefore, all we know
and conceive is mental.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Historical Clue</div>

<p class='c007'>This sketch of the course of events in
philosophical speculation will at least
enable the reader to follow the historical
clue to the evolution
of ideas. Every student
must, in order
to attain a true perspective,
know the <i>genealogy</i> of the ideas
he is studying. It will therefore be best
that he first read the general articles
referred to in the beginning of this

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Science of Rearing Children</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The new Encyclopaedia Britannica
is full of encouragement for
parents who are tempted to feel
that the proper care and training of a
child require almost superhuman skill
and energy. Many of the fears and
doubts by which they are beset rest
upon vague traditions, handed down
from a day when a child’s health was
threatened by more dangers and greater
dangers than now, and when much less
was known than is known to-day about
the training of a child. Statistics are
dull things, as a rule, but it would be
difficult to find pleasanter reading than
the statistical tables which show how
much the modern progress of science has
done for children. And these figures,
in many Britannica articles on various
diseases and localities, by showing how
much safer children’s lives are than they
used to be, also indicate a <i>decrease of
children’s suffering</i> and an <i>increase of
children’s happiness</i> which cannot be
expressed in numbers. Sheer ignorance
caused much of the pain that children
used to suffer and also much of the neglect
that led to bodily and mental deficiency
in later life. There is still room
for improvement; but it is no exaggeration
to say that the child of the average
American mechanic is more intelligently
cared for than was, a hundred years ago,
the heir to a European kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every branch of science has contributed
to these improved conditions. Medical
and surgical research have no doubt
been the great factors, as disease and
deformity were the worst evils; but the
child’s mind has been as carefully studied
as its body. Here, again, figures cannot
tell the whole story. They can show the
universal benefits of our public school
system, but they cannot show how greatly
the children of well-read and thoughtful
parents benefit by home influences intelligently
exerted. That element of
education begins as soon as a child is
born, and it is based upon such observation
of its individual needs as only a
parent’s affection and sympathy can
achieve. And in this part of the parent’s
task, as in the case of the child’s health,
it is essential to be guided by specialists
of the highest authority, such as those
who wrote for the Britannica the articles
of which a brief account is given in this
chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The child’s individuality, physical and
mental, is largely inherited.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is Known about Heredity</div>

<p class='c007'>The vast subject of heredity has indeed
not yet been reduced to an exact
science, but the newest theories advanced
by Weismann, Hertwig, and others, with
such confirmation as has already been obtained,
are clearly set forth in Dr. P.
Chalmers Mitchell’s article <span class='sc'>Heredity</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 350). As for our knowledge
of the physiological process of
heredity, the foundation may be said to
have been laid by the labours of the Austrian
monk Mendel, and biologists are
rapidly extending his work in various
directions. What has been done in the
past thirteen years since scientists rediscovered
Mendel’s work is described in
<span class='sc'>Mendelism</span> (Vol. 18, p. 115), by R. C.
Punnett, professor of biology, Cambridge
University. There is no subject
of greater interest or fascination before
the world to-day, and there is no better
or simpler introduction to it than Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Punnett’s able article. As he says,
“Increased knowledge of our heredity
means increased power of control over
the living thing.” We know very little
as yet, but that little “offers the hope
of a great extension at no very distant
time. If this hope is borne out, if it
is shown that the qualities of man, his
body and his intellect, his immunities
and his diseases, even his very virtues
and vices, are dependent upon the ascertainable
presence or absence of definite
unit-characters whose mode of transmission
follows fixed laws, and if also
man decides that his life shall be ordered
in the light of this knowledge, it is obvious
that the social system will have to
undergo considerable changes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The relations between parent and offspring
are also dealt with in <span class='sc'>Reproduction</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 116), by Dr. Mitchell;
and those who wish to study the development
of the organism will find such
information in <span class='sc'>Embryology</span> (Vol. 9,
p. 314), by Adam Sedgwick, who is
professor of zoology at the Imperial College
of Science and Technology, London.
This masterly account is supplemented
by a section (p. 329) on the <i>Physiology
of Development</i> by Dr. Hans A. E.
Driesch, of Heidelberg University.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The New-Born Child</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Infancy</span> (Vol. 14, p. 513),
by Dr. Harriet Hennessy, is devoted to
the care of the child during its first
year. The first bath, care of the eyes,
clothing, increase of weight, etc., are
thoroughly discussed, and the directions
for artificial feeding contain tables of
milk-dilution and of the amounts to be
given. In <span class='sc'>Child</span> (Vol. 6, p. 136) will be
found a valuable table of average heights
and weights of children from the ages of
one to fifteen, and a full bibliography of
works relating to child-study.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main points to be considered for
each sex in the difficult period between
childhood and maturity are concisely
set forth in <span class='sc'>Adolescence</span> (Vol. 1, p. 210).
An ideal system of child raising is outlined,
dealing with hygiene, clothing,
and moral and physical training. See
also <span class='sc'>Gymnastics and Gymnasium</span> (Vol.
12, p. 752), by R. J. McNeill.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Vital Question of Food</div>

<p class='c007'>Parents must have a thorough and
clear understanding of the question of
bodily nourishment. This is most imperative.
It means sound bodies for the
children, their good health in after years,
their efficiency and success in life. On
this point the new Britannica provides
information of a character that for
authoritativeness and completeness can
nowhere else be matched.</p>

<p class='c007'>The important matter of feeding a
family is treated at great length in
<span class='sc'>Dietetics</span> (Vol. 8, p. 214), by the late
Prof. W. O. Atwater of Wesleyan University,
known the world over as an
authority on this subject, and R. D. Milner,
formerly assistant in the U. S. Department
of Agriculture. The article
gives information as to the composition
and nutritive values of foods and their
adaptation to the use of people in health.
There are tables of food composition, of
the digestibility of nutrients, of the
quantities of available nutrients, etc.
The hygienic and pecuniary economy of
food are discussed in such a way as to
be of real service. For those who desire
further information on the subject of
food assimilation reference may be made
to <span class='sc'>Nutrition</span> (Vol. 19, p. 920), by Dr.
D. Noel Paton, professor of physiology,
University of Glasgow, and Dr. E. P.
Cathcart, lecturer in chemical physiology
in the same institution.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Maintenance of Health</div>

<p class='c007'>In regard to the maintenance of general
health of children without reference
to specific ailments there is a vast fund
of information to be extracted by consulting
the new Britannica. The titles
of a few of the articles will sufficiently indicate
information to which every parent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>should have constant access: <span class='sc'>Antiseptics</span>

(Vol. 24, p. 991). There is a section
on <i>Action of Baths on the Human System</i>,
in <span class='sc'>Baths and Bathing</span> (Vol. 3, p.
518), telling of the effects of cold, tepid,
warm, hot, and very hot baths.</p>

<p class='c007'>Parents will be most grateful to the
Britannica for the complete descriptions
of infantile diseases, dealing with symptoms
and principles of cure and treatment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Treatment of Infantile Diseases</div>

<p class='c007'><i>The British Medical Journal</i> commenting
on the nature of the medical
section of the new Britannica has said
that it is “an admirable example of the
kind of exposition which will enable the
head of a family, without embarrassing
him with technical details, to deal
with a situation with which he may
be confronted at any
moment.” Realizing the great necessity
for a popular yet authentic discussion
of diseases, the editors have produced a
work which has received the highest
approval of the medical world for its
quality of practical usefulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first place, parents should devote
much study to Sir T. Lauder Brunton’s
most clear and able discussion of
<span class='sc'>Therapeutics</span> (Vol. 26, p. 793), dealing in
a general manner with the means employed
to treat disease. Here we learn about
the action of microbes, the nature of inflammation
and fever (which are protective
processes calculated to defend the organism
against the attacks of microbes but
which often become injurious), about defensive
measures and principles of cure,
proper nutrition and elimination, flatulence,
constipation, etc. It is also important
to know something about the
action of drugs, and this is fully explained
in <span class='sc'>Pharmacology</span> (Vol. 21, p. 350), by
Dr. Ralph Stockman, of Glasgow University,
while Dr. H. L. Hennessy in the
same article (p. 352) explains the terms
used in the classification of drugs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before describing the material devoted
to the special diseases of children,
it is well to remind parents of a valuable
illustrated article on <span class='sc'>Parasitic
Diseases</span> (Vol. 20, p. 770), by Dr. G.
Sims Woodhead, professor of pathology
in Cambridge University. It is about the
length of 52 pages in this Guide. The
information as to the origin of various
diseases, of those which are due to vegetable
and those due to animal parasites,
of the infective diseases in which no
organism yet discovered has surely been
connected with the malady (as is the case
with scarlet fever), and of infective diseases,
such as measles, mumps, and
whooping-cough, not yet traced to microorganisms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>will prove of the highest
interest because the facts related have
a most important influence upon present
methods of treatment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Diseases most Common to Childhood</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Croup</span> (Vol. 7, p. 511) is a concise
account of spasmodic croup—so terrifying
to all parents. The treatment is carefully
described. The same
is true of <span class='sc'>Tonsillitis</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 11).
For other common
throat diseases see
<span class='sc'>Bronchitis</span> (Vol. 4, p. 634); <span class='sc'>Respiratory
System</span>, <i>Pathology of</i> (Vol. 23, p. 195)
by Dr. Thomas Harris, a noted authority,
and Dr. Harriet Hennessy, and <span class='sc'>Laryngitis</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 228), which fully describes
the paroxysmal laryngitis so peculiarly
fatal to infants. In all these
articles reference is made to adenoids as
a contributing cause of the maladies described.
There is a separate account of
these recently discovered troublesome
growths, <span class='sc'>Adenoids</span> (Vol. 1, p. 191), and
of the comparatively simple operation
for their removal, by Dr. Edmund Owen,
consulting surgeon to the Children’s
Hospital, London.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great attention which, in recent
years, has been paid to <span class='sc'>Diphtheria</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 290) has produced most striking
results. We know its cause and
nature, we understand the conditions
which influence its prevalence; and a
“specific” cure in an antitoxin has been
found. Specialists now trace to diphtheria
many of the serious cases which
would formerly have been thought due
to other diseases, and especially to croup.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Whooping Cough</span> (Vol. 28, p. 616) is
one of the most common diseases of
infancy, but, except in the most extreme
cases, does not require the regular attendance
of a physician. The malady
has three recognized stages, in the second
of which complications are apt to arise
which may become a source of danger
greater than the malady itself. Parents
should also understand the curious structural
changes in the lungs which sometimes
remain after the disease has run
its course.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all the diseases of earlier childhood,
<span class='sc'>Measles</span> (Vol. 17, p. 947) is the most
prevalent, and its spread is largely due
to the fact that its initial symptoms
are slight and not easily recognizable.
The proper understanding of these is,
therefore, most necessary, as well as a
thorough appreciation of possible complications
and their consequences. The
best mode of treatment is also indicated
in this article. There are several well-marked
varieties of <span class='sc'>Scarlet Fever</span> (Vol.
24, p. 303) of which the chief are simple
scarlatina, septic scarlatina, and malignant
scarlatina; and the complications
and effects of the disease are among the
most important features which should be
understood. The list of infantile diseases
is too long for specific description,
but parents can appreciate the value and
significance of this valuable department
of the work by referring to such articles
as <span class='sc'>Mumps</span> (Vol. 18, p. 968); <span class='sc'>Dysentery</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 785); <span class='sc'>Cholera</span> (Vol. 6, p. 262),
with a special section on children’s simple
cholera; see also <span class='sc'>Digestive Organs</span>,
<i>General and Local Diseases</i> (Vol. 8, p. 262)
by Dr. A. L. Gillespie, lecturer on modern
gastric methods, Edinburgh Post-Graduate
School, and <span class='sc'>Meningitis</span>, <i>Cerebro-Spinal</i>
(Vol. 18, p. 130), with an account
of the new and successful serum
treatment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mental Training</div>

<p class='c007'>In planning the groundwork of education,
parents should have a clear
idea of the principles of modern instruction.
Here the
Britannica again
comes to their assistance.
The biographies
of <span class='sc'>Pestalozzi</span> (Vol. 21, p.
284) and of <span class='sc'>Froebel</span> (Vol. 11, p. 238) describe
the insistence of these leaders on
the need of educating a child through
his own activity, and the results they
obtained by this method. Further elaboration
of the subject is given in <span class='sc'>Education</span>,
<i>Theory</i> (Vol. 8, p. 951), by James
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>Welton, professor of education in the
University of Leeds, to which article
there are added detailed accounts of
national systems of education. An interesting
supplementary article is <span class='sc'>Schools</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 359), by A. F. Leach, describing
the stages of experiment by which our
modern idea of a school has been developed.
There is an admirably instructive
article, <span class='sc'>Technical Education</span> (Vol. 26,
p. 487), by Sir Philip Magnus, formerly
member of the Royal Commission of
Technical Instruction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Assistance at Home in School Education</div>

<p class='c007'>The new Britannica performs a service
of the greatest importance in responding
to the opening mind of the child. Children
are the greatest
of question askers,
and the Britannica
is the best question
answerer ever devised.
They want to know about the
races of men, the different animals and
plants they see; in fact, almost every
object that comes under their observation.
The inestimable advantage of answering
an inquiry fully and correctly
and not in an offhand manner is too obvious
to need mention. <i>Let your young
children see you go to your Britannica for
information and as soon as they are
old enough they will naturally do the
same, and then the volumes will be performing
their most efficient work in the
household.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>For helping children with their school
“themes” and “compositions,” for elucidation
or amplification of any topic
that comes up in the course of their
studies, there is no medium so useful as
the new Britannica—the most exhaustive
compendium of knowledge which
has ever been devised, with its elaborate
index of 500,000 alphabetical references,
giving instant access to every fact in
the whole work. Of equal assistance will
be its employment in connection with
Sunday School lessons; for the accounts
of the Bible and its separate books,
giving the latest results of Biblical criticism,
are the product of the highest
learning of the age.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The World of Nature</div>

<p class='c007'>For the instruction of children about
the history of mankind, the nature of
the universe, the animal, plant, and mineral
world, the new
Britannica offers a
complete fund of
necessary knowledge.
There are 277 astronomical articles, including
biographies; 889 zoological articles;
675 on plants; 380 on minerals
and rocks. The classified subject-list
in the Index Volume places the whole of
this material immediately before the eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>The articles <span class='sc'>Anthropology</span> (Vol. 2,
p. 108), by Dr. Edward B. Tylor of Oxford
University, dean of living anthropologists,
and <span class='sc'>Ethnology and Ethnography</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 849) describe the races
of mankind, man’s place in nature, the
origin of man, and his antiquity. The
main article <span class='sc'>Zoology</span> (Vol. 28, p. 1022),
by Sir Edwin Ray Lankester, of London
University, is an introduction to knowledge
of the whole of the animal world,
which is amplified, with minute details,
in separate accounts of all members of
the animal kingdom. <span class='sc'>Zoological Distribution</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 1002), by the noted
naturalist, Richard Lydekker, is a mine of
information about the distribution of
living animals and their forerunners on
the surface of the globe. Articles of
great importance are <span class='sc'>Botany</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 299), by Dr. A. B. Rendle of the British
Museum, and the great article <span class='sc'>Plants</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 728), in the various sections
of which the whole story of the vegetable
world is told by eight famous specialists.
There are, of course, separate articles on
all plants. We also recommend to parents
a careful study of the section (Vol.
23, p. 120) of <span class='sc'>Reproduction</span>, <i>Reproduction
of Plants</i>, by Dr. S. H. Vines, and
<span class='sc'>Pollination</span> (Vol. 22, p. 2), from which
they can give their children much necessary
instruction. Such a course is now
strongly advised by educators and authorities
in child-study as the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>method of preparing the mind for a
healthy, sane knowledge of sex matters
in later years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What Happens on the Earth and in the Air</div>

<p class='c007'>In teaching rudimentary things about
the heavens, it is well to note that <span class='sc'>Constellation</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 11), by Charles

reading <span class='sc'>Star</span> (Vol. 25, p. 784), by A. S.
Eddington, of the Royal Observatory,

<div class='sidenote'>The Foundation of Good Taste</div>

<p class='c007'>An important service to education is
rendered by the Britannica in the way
that it supplements and extends education
received in
the school. There,
far too often children
learn little or
nothing of the world of art, of the
beautiful creations of the human intellect
by means of which, even before the
dawn of history, men attempted to express
in concrete form their sense of
beauty. It is surely most desirable for
children to have an idea, at least, of
principles and styles of architecture; of
ancient and modern painting and sculpture—to
know the chief characteristics of
schools of art; to have a little knowledge
of musical forms, of what a symphony,
a concerto, a sonata, an opera, are; to
be able to recognize a piece of Dresden,
Sèvres, Italian faience, Copenhagen, or
Wedgwood ware when they see it; to
know the different periods and styles
of furniture; to tell Bohemian from
Venetian glass; to be familiar with
lovely textiles and fabrics and to appreciate
their true value. Such knowledge
is the foundation of good taste. It serves
to arouse appreciation of, and respect for,
the objects with which a child is surrounded,
and leads to delightful interests,
recreations and occupations in later years.
There are few better and more constant
uses to which the Britannica can be put
than the systematic education of children
in matters of general culture and refined
taste.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Knowledge of the Fine Arts</div>

<p class='c007'>A list of articles to serve this purpose
would be too long to give here. They are
easily found by means of other chapters
in this Guide. But
special mention may
be made of <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>
(Vol. 2, p.
369), by R. Phené Spiers, master of the
architectural school, Royal Academy,
London, by John Bilson, of the University
of Manchester, and others; <span class='sc'>Painting</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 459), by Prof. G. B. Brown of
Edinburgh University; L. Bénédite, keeper
of the Luxembourg Gallery, Paris;
Richard Muther, professor of modern art,
Breslau University; and John C. Van
Dyke, professor of history of art, Rutgers
College; <span class='sc'>Sculpture</span> (Vol. 24 p. 488), by
Marion H. Spielmann, formerly editor,
<i>Magazine of Art</i>, P. G. Konody, art critic
of the <i>Observer</i>, L. Bénédite, and Dr. J. H.
Middleton, Slade professor of fine art,
Cambridge University; <span class='sc'>Ceramics</span> (Vol.
5, p. 703), by Hon. William Burton, chairman,
Joint Committee of Pottery Manufacturers
of Great Britain, R. L. Hobson
of the British Museum, and other authorities;
<span class='sc'>Glass</span> (Vol. 12, p. 86), by
Alexander Nesbitt, H. J. Powell, author of
<i>Glass Making</i>, and Dr. W. Rosenhain of
the National Physical Laboratory, England;
<span class='sc'>Lace</span> (Vol. 16, p. 37), by A. S.
Cole, author of <i>Embroidery and Lace</i>;
<span class='sc'>Furniture</span> (Vol. 11, p. 363), by J. Penderel-Brodhurst.
All of these articles are
superbly illustrated, and this feature
alone would give them a direct educational
value for young people.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Best Picture-Book in the World</div>

<p class='c007'>In fact, the new Britannica may be
said to be the greatest and most varied
picture book in existence. There are
7,000 text illustrations
and 450 full-page
plates. This
suggests at once a
special use for the
work in making children familiar, by
purely pictorial means, with objects they
should learn to recognize. When a child
asks for a description of some object
whose name has aroused his curiosity, it
is safe to say that an accurate picture of
it will be found in the new Britannica.
Suppose that he has heard of a dirigible
balloon and wants to know how it differs
from the ordinary balloon which he has
seen. The index will guide his instructor
to the article <span class='sc'>Aeronautics</span> (Vol. 1, p.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>260), with two full-page plates of dirigible
balloons. A child can learn to distinguish
the breeds of domestic animals
from the illustrations alone. Thirst for
mechanical knowledge may be satisfied
by such articles as <span class='sc'>Steam Engine</span> (Vol.
25, p. 818), with about 70 illustrations,
by Prof. J. A. Ewing, of Cambridge University;
<span class='sc'>Watch</span> (Vol. 28, p. 362), by
Lord Grimthorpe and Sir H. H. Cunynghame;
<span class='sc'>Lighthouse</span> (Vol. 16, p. 627), by
W. T. Douglass and N. G. Gedye; <span class='sc'>Telephone</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 547), by Emile
Garcke; and <span class='sc'>Lock</span> (Vol. 16, p. 841), by
A. B. Chatwood—all fully illustrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sport and Recreation</div>

<p class='c007'>The new Britannica is an exhaustive
and practical compendium of sports,
games, and recreations of all kinds. Part
6 of this Guide contains
a survey of
this department in
the book. There are
over 260 articles on sports and games
alone, and they describe clearly how each
is played, and also give expert advice.
There is also much that is extremely
interesting in the historical development
of pastimes, a knowledge of which heightens
the interest and pleasure of those
who participate in them; and parents
can be of real assistance to their children
in instructing them about their sports,
and by acquiring this information themselves
can give sympathetic appreciation
to the children’s amusements. Among
the noteworthy contributions on sports
and games there are <span class='sc'>Children’s Games</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 141), an article for parents by
Alice B. Gomme, an expert on this subject;
<span class='sc'>Games, Classical</span> (Vol. 11, p. 443),
an account which every boy will read
with pleasure, by Francis Storr, editor
of the <i>Journal of Education</i>, London;
<span class='sc'>Athletic Sports</span> (Vol. 2, p. 846); <span class='sc'>Base-Ball</span>
(Vol. 3, p. 458), by Edward Breck;
<span class='sc'>Basket-Ball</span> (Vol. 3, p. 483), <span class='sc'>Football</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 617), of which the American
section is written by Walter Camp,
the football expert; <span class='sc'>Kite-flying</span> (Vol.
15, p. 839), by Major-Gen. Baden Powell;
<span class='sc'>Marbles</span> (Vol. 17, p. 679), by W. E.
Garrett Fisher; <span class='sc'>Lawn Tennis</span> (Vol. 16,
p. 300), by R. J. McNeill; <span class='sc'>Swimming</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 231), by William Henry,
founder and chief secretary of the Royal
Life Saving Society; <span class='sc'>Skating</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 166), and <span class='sc'>Coasting</span> (Vol. 6, p. 603).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Diverting Occupations</div>

<p class='c007'>Recreation in the form of diverting
occupations is sometimes more attractive
to children, especially to those of a practical
turn of mind,
than sports and
games. It is often
difficult for parents
to encourage these inclinations, since they
themselves may not be familiar with the
subjects for which their children show a
special aptitude, and a real talent may
thus fail to be cultivated. As soon as any
particular bent in the child is discovered,
a parent ought to consider it a duty to
learn to help the boy or girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new Encyclopaedia Britannica will,
on all subjects of diverting occupations,
prove of immense practical assistance
to parents. They will find all that they
need to know to help their children under
such headings as <span class='sc'>Photography</span> (Vol. 21,
p. 485), by Sir William de Wiveleslie
Abney, formerly president of the Royal
Photographic Society, James Waterhouse
also a former president of the same society,
who writes on photographic apparatus,
and A. H. Hinton, author of <i>Practical
Pictorial Photography</i>, etc.; <span class='sc'>Bee</span>,
<i>Bee Keeping</i> (Vol. 3, p. 628), by W. B.
Carr, formerly editor of the <i>Bee-Keeper’s
Record</i>; the article <span class='sc'>Aviary</span>, on the keeping
of birds (Vol. 3, p. 60), by David Seth-Smith,
formerly president of the Avicultural
Society; <span class='sc'>Poultry and Poultry

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Importance of Correct First Impressions</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>When a stick of hot glass is drawn
out, no matter how far it is
stretched, the slender stick retains
the original shape of the piece—square,
round or oval. In the same way,
a child’s mind retains in after life the
shaping originally given to it. Everyone
knows from personal
experience how difficult
it is to rid the
mind of a wrong
impression received
in childhood. The editors of the new Britannica
feel that they have solved a
great problem in making a work of the
most <i>accurate</i> and <i>authoritative</i> character
<i>interesting to children</i>, for they have received
much valuable testimony that this
end has been attained. Dr. Charles W.
Eliot, president-emeritus of Harvard
University, was an early subscriber for
two sets for the use of his grandchildren.
He said that he found the work “altogether
admirable; and my grandchildren,
who are at the most inquisitive ages,
are of the same opinion.” Professor
W. G. Hale, of the University of Chicago,
wrote, “My children feel the same fascination
in it that I do.” Judge J. P.
Gorter, of the Baltimore Supreme Court,
has expressed his opinion that “every
family with growing children seeking
information should have this invaluable
work in the library.” The owner of
the new Britannica should constantly
encourage his children to go to the
volumes for further information on topics
included in the course of the day’s studies
at school. It will not take long to make
them realize that the volumes open an
inexhaustible mine of knowledge, and
answer any question as to which curiosity
has been aroused. With a little
help from you, at the beginning, they
will soon learn to use the Britannica
for themselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Britannica Interesting to Children</div>

<p class='c007'>The love of reading is quickly developed
in children. Some are attracted to
history, to the lives of great men, to
exploration and to
adventure; others
become more interested
in the world
of nature; still others
have a natural bent toward science and
the mechanical arts. Whatever the inclination
may be, the Britannica stands
at the child’s service, giving to him the
true facts in such a way that he can
easily understand them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following suggestions will help
children to pursue their favourite lines of
reading. They may like to begin with
the heroes of myth and history. Andrew
Lang contributes a most comprehensive
article on <span class='sc'>Mythology</span> (Vol. 19, p. 128).
The classified subject-list in Vol. 29
(Index) indicates nearly 500 separate
articles on the gods and mythological
beings of ancient Greece and Rome, Asia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>Egypt, Europe and America. The central
hero of medieval romance, <span class='sc'>Arthur</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 681), is described by Miss
Jessie L. Weston, author of <i>Arthurian
Romances</i>. The famous deeds of the <span class='sc'>Cid</span>
(Vol. 6, p. 361), the foremost man of
Spain’s heroic period, are related by H.
E. Watts, the well-known translator of
<i>Don Quixote</i>. <span class='sc'>Roland, Legend of</span> (Vol.
23, p. 464), tells another stirring story.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Heroes and Heroines of History, Romance and Adventure</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Romance of the Middle Ages</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Heroes of Later Times</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Famous Women of History</div>

<p class='c007'>Of peculiar interest to children are
such articles as <i>Cyrus (The Great)</i>,

<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span><span class='sc'>Victoria, Queen</span> (Vol. 28, p. 28), by
Hugh Chisholm, editor, Encyclopaedia
Britannica.</p>

<p class='c007'>The biographies are not dry outlines
of the subjects’ lives, but narratives of a
thoroughly interesting and often most
entertaining nature. There has been a
generous amount of space alloted the
biographical articles in the Encyclopaedia
Britannica. The article on Napoleon I
is equivalent to 60 pages of this Guide;
that of George Washington to 13 pages;
of Abraham Lincoln to 23 pages; of Queen
Victoria 23 pages. Such length provides
space for the picturesque details which
make the articles especially appropriate
for children, and will establish a taste
for this kind of reading in later years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Readings in Natural History</div>

<p class='c007'>Many children show a bent for knowledge
of the world of nature, and to
them the new Britannica will prove a
faithful, constant
companion. Their
pleasure in going to
the encyclopaedia
will be heightened by
the many beautiful pictures they will find
in it. The articles on the domestic animals
not only relate in simple, readable
fashion the very interesting facts
about their history and development,
but are splendidly illustrated with pictures
of the different breeds so that by
this means alone anyone may learn to
distinguish them. <span class='sc'>Cat</span> (Vol. 5, p. 487),
is by Richard Lydekker, the noted
naturalist; <span class='sc'>Cattle</span> (Vol. 5, p. 539) is
by Dr. William Fream, author of <i>Handbook
of Agriculture</i>, and Robert Wallace,
professor of agriculture, Edinburgh University;
<span class='sc'>Dog</span> (Vol. 8, p. 374) is by Walter
Baxendale, kennel editor of <i>The Field</i>,
and Dr. F. Chalmers Mitchell; <span class='sc'>Horse</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 712) is by Sir William Henry
Flower, the noted biologist, author of
<i>The Horse, a Study in Natural History</i>,
Richard Lydekker, E. D. Brickwood, Dr.
William Fream and Robert Wallace;
<span class='sc'>Pig</span> (Vol. 21, p. 594) is by Robert
Wallace, and <span class='sc'>Sheep</span> (Vol. 24, p. 817)
is by Dr. Fream and Professor Wallace.</p>

<p class='c007'>In too many books for children
about the habits of wild animals, the
facts of nature are grossly distorted with
the idea of impressing the imagination.
We are all familiar with the recent
spirited controversy over “nature fakers”
and the reaction to more sober statement
which it brought about. It is the truth
about the animal world that is wanted;
for it is quite wonderful and fascinating
enough as it is. And the new Britannica
supplies this need in a most satisfactory
and thorough manner. Children never
tire of natural history, and parents may
be assured that the information in the
entertaining articles by noted naturalists,
in the pages of the Britannica, is of the
most reliable and accurate character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Habits and Doings of Clever Animals</div>

<p class='c007'>Nothing, for instance, could be more
absorbing to the average school-child
than the article <span class='sc'>Ant</span> (Vol. 2, p. 85), by
Prof. George H. Carpenter
of the Royal
College of Science,
Dublin, who wrote
the well-known book
<i>Insects; their Structure and Life.</i> Here
he tells how colonies of ants are founded,
and how they live, and how they receive
other insects as guests in order to obtain
the food they desire, and how some
species make slaves of other species.
Numerous examples of their sense and
intelligence are given, and the question
as to whether their actions are rational
or instinctive is discussed in the light
of the most recent knowledge. The
story of the <span class='sc'>Bee</span> (Vol. 3, p. 625), also
by Professor Carpenter, is equally wonderful,
for we learn all about the solitary
and social bees, the social organization
of the hive, and how the worker bees
are victimized. Both of these articles
are fully illustrated. <span class='sc'>Spiders</span> (Vol. 25,
p. 663), by R. I. Pocock, superintendent
of the Zoological Gardens, London, is
another example of the adaptability of
the Britannica to children’s reading.
The accounts of their webs, nests and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>modes of catching prey hold the attention
throughout.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great deal of the most curious and
recent knowledge of the animal kingdom
is related in supplementary articles such
as <span class='sc'>Colours of Animals</span> (Vol. 6, p. 731),
by Dr. E. B. Poulton, Hope professor of
zoology at Oxford, author of <i>The Colours
of Animals</i>, and <span class='sc'>Mimicry</span> (Vol.
18, p. 495), by R. I. Pocock. The latter
tells how animals protect themselves
from their enemies by resemblance to
other animals or objects.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Knowledge about Plants and Animals</div>

<p class='c007'>Space will not permit further specific
mention. The life-story of the entire
animal kingdom, detailed information
about plants and
flowers are to be
found in the pages
of the new Britannica.
The accurate
and beautiful illustrations and the text,
written in every case by naturalists of
acknowledged reputation, and written
always in the clearest language, help
to give the work its unique position as
the greatest source of authoritative and
easily comprehended knowledge.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Marvelous Machines</div>

<p class='c007'>Children delight in machinery and
what it accomplishes, and the Britannica
tells about this with great thoroughness
in its complete section
dealing with
processes of manufacture.
A number of
the articles on this subject have been
suggested in the last chapter as suitable
for parents who wish to interest their
children in the industrial world, and the
list may be further extended for the benefit
of older children by including such
articles as <span class='sc'>Textile Printing</span> (Vol. 26,
p. 694), by Dr. Edmund Knecht, of Manchester
University; <span class='sc'>Finishing</span> (Vol. 10,
p. 378) also by Professor Knecht; <span class='sc'>Wool,
Worsted and Woollen Manufactures</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 805), by Aldred F. Barker,
professor of textile industries, Bradford
Technical College; <span class='sc'>Typography</span>, <i>Modern
Practical Typography</i> (Vol. 27, p.
542), by John Southward, author of
<i>Practical Printing</i>, and H. M. Ross;
<span class='sc'>Printing</span> (Vol. 22, p. 350), by C. T.
Jacobi, managing director of the Chiswick
Press, London; <span class='sc'>Dredge and Dredging</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 562), by Walter Hunter,
a noted consulting engineer; <span class='sc'>Reaping</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 944), by Primrose McConnell,
author of <i>Diary of a Working Farmer</i>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boys with a practical, mechanical turn
of mind will delight in such articles as
<span class='sc'>Bridges</span> (Vol. 4, p. 533), by Prof. W. C.
Unwin, with many illustrations; <span class='sc'>Motor
Vehicles</span> (Vol. 18, p. 914), by the late
C. S. Rolls, a pioneer of motoring, and
Edward S. Smith; <span class='sc'>Flight and Flying</span>,
<i>Artificial Flight</i> (Vol. 10, p. 510), which
describes, with many pictures, flying machines
from the earliest types to the
latest, and <span class='sc'>Cycling</span> (Vol. 7, p. 682), an
historical and pictorial account of the
velocipede and bicycle. Nothing could
be more interesting and instructive than
<span class='sc'>Ship</span> (Vol. 24, p. 860), of which the historical
part is by Rev. Edmond Warre,
formerly head master of Eton College,
and the account of modern ships by Sir
Philip Watts, who designed the “Dreadnought”
and the “Mauretania.” It is a
real story, equivalent in length to 190
pages of this Guide, with nearly 130
illustrations of all sorts of craft including
modern warships, ocean liners and vessels
for inland navigation. Under <span class='sc'>Railways</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 819) there is an equally
good history of the railway by H. M.
Ross, editor of <i>The Times Engineering
Supplement</i>, and others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Electrical Apparatus</div>

<p class='c007'>The remarkable attraction possessed
by electrical apparatus for many boys
will doubtless send them to such articles
as <span class='sc'>Dynamo</span> (Vol. 8,
p. 764), by C. C.
Hawkins, author of
<i>The Dynamo</i>; <span class='sc'>Telephone</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 547), by Harry R.
Kempe, electrician to the General Post
Office, London; <span class='sc'>Telegraph</span> (Vol. 26, p.
510), also by H. R. Kempe, and the
chapter on <i>Wireless Telegraphy</i> (p. 529),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>by J. A. Fleming, professor of electrical
engineering in the University of London.
These accounts are full of the most
practical information, and will be of inestimable
help to any boy who wishes to
experiment for himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Industrial Processes</div>

<p class='c007'>Many industrial processes, while not
employing complicated machinery, nevertheless
possess much interest, both
from an historical
and a technical point
of view, and on these
the new Britannica is
as complete and authentic as in all other
departments. Especially useful and entertaining
to children will be found the
material relating to the manufacture of
the common objects by which they are
surrounded. Such, for instance, are
<span class='sc'>Ceramics</span> (Vol. 5, p. 703), by William
Burton and several other experts, with
beautiful illustrations; <span class='sc'>Glass</span> (Vol. 12,
p. 86), by Harry James Powell, author
of <i>Glass Making</i>, etc., Alexander Nesbitt,
and William Rosenhain of the National
Physical Laboratory, England; and <span class='sc'>Process</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 408), an illustrated
account, by Edwin Bale, of the photomechanical
processes by which illustrations
are reproduced in printing.</p>

<p class='c007'>These and hundreds of similar articles
will prove most helpful and suggestive
to school-children who are constantly
called on to prepare “themes” and write
compositions. As soon as a child makes
acquaintance with the new Britannica
he will quickly realize its inexhaustible
resources, and the aid it lends him in his
studies will be continued throughout the
course of his life, in his business and in
his general reading.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Explorers’ Voyages and Journeys</div>

<p class='c007'>Children love to read adventures of
explorers in forcing their way to unknown
lands. The impression they make is
much clearer when
the child has learned
to distinguish the
different motives
which have led to
discovery and to exploration—commercial
expansion, fresh conquests, religious
zeal, flight from persecution, or the advancement
of knowledge for its own
sake. With such information he will read
in a new light the stirring history of adventure,
the great story of hardship and
endurance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Britannica presents all this on a
definite, scientific plan. The inquirer
starts on his trip through any field of
learning with guide-posts clearly marked,
and successive ones in sight one from the
other; so that there is no going astray, no
uncertain wandering. A reader—young
or old—with taste for exploration and
adventure may turn first to <span class='sc'>Geography</span>,
<i>Progress of Geographical Discovery</i> (Vol.
11, p. 623), by Dr. H. R. Mill, editor of
<i>The International Geography.</i> This article
outlines geographical discovery in
chronological order from the days of the
Phoenicians. The reader will doubtless
make excursions into other parts of the
books for more detailed accounts, but he
has always this main article to guide him.
He will go to the article on <span class='sc'>Herodotus</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 381), the traveler, by Canon
George Rawlinson, the great Oriental
archaeologist, and the Rev. E. M. Walker
of Oxford University; and to the story of
<span class='sc'>Pytheas</span> (Vol. 22, p. 703), the Greek
navigator who brought the first definite
news of northwestern Europe to the
Mediterranean world, by Sir Edward H.

<div class='sidenote'>Modern Exploration</div>

<p class='c007'>The story of geographical discovery

<div class='sidenote'>A Complete History of the World</div>

<p class='c007'>A strong taste for history is often found
in children, and the new Britannica is,
among other things, a complete history
of the world, by the
greatest historians of
the present day. In
respect to the treatment
and arrangement
of the historical section there are
many things that make it especially
adapted for young people’s reading. In
the first place the great episodes of history,
such as <span class='sc'>French Revolution,
Renaissance, Reformation, Middle
Ages</span>, and <span class='sc'>Crusades</span>, are discussed in
separate articles. Also every battle,
siege, campaign, or war of importance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>has its article, apart from its treatment
in the histories of countries. The historical
articles in the new Britannica will
send those a little older to other articles
dealing with government, and thus help
them to cope intelligently with the social
and civic problems of the age—in other
words, enable them to become the best
kind of citizens. The chapter in this
Guide headed <i>Questions of the Day</i> covers
this ground; and see the chapters on
<i>History</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A child is naturally curious to know
about mountains, rivers, caverns, the
causes of rain, dew and wind. Just as
this encyclopaedia shows itself the best
of instructors in regard to the plant and
animal world, so with natural phenomena
it serves to bring the child into close,
sympathetic touch with the truths of
science.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Physical Geography made Interesting</div>

<p class='c007'>The principles of physical geography
are clearly explained in <span class='sc'>Geography</span>,
<i>Principles of</i> (Vol. 11, p. 630), by Dr. H.
R. Mill; and when
these are learned
young people will
turn with eager interest

by Edward Heawood, librarian of the
Royal Geographical Society, London, and
F. R. Cana. There are also separate
articles on the oceans and large lakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Astronomy is a science which is
peculiarly attractive to children, since it
arouses the imagination and makes a
strong appeal to their delight in all that
is marvelous. There are 277 astronomical
articles in the new Encyclopaedia
Britannica to which the classified list in
the Index Volume (Vol. 29, p. 888) is the
key.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Readings in Astronomy</div>

<p class='c007'>In the preceding chapter are mentioned
a few articles which will serve
for the beginning
of an acquaintance
with astronomy.
When a child has
learned to know the zodiacal constellations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>he will certainly want to read
<span class='sc'>Zodiac</span> (Vol. 28, p. 993), by Agnes M.
Clerke, author of <i>A History of Astronomy
in the 19th Century</i>, for the story of the
signs and what they meant to the nations
of past ages. There are separate articles
on the principal constellations and stars.
<span class='sc'>Astrology</span> (Vol. 2, p. 795), by Prof.
Morris Jastrow of the University of
Pennsylvania, will prove both entertaining
and instructive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who wish to know about methods
of observation will find the complete
story in <span class='sc'>Telescope</span> (Vol. 26, p. 557), a
beautifully illustrated article by H.
Dennis Taylor, author of <i>A System of
Applied Optics</i>, and Sir David Gill, formerly
astronomer royal at the Cape of
Good Hope.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Games and Pastimes</div>

<p class='c007'>In the preceding chapter a few articles
on games were mentioned as being
useful to parents helping very
young children to
amuse themselves. A
little later, the child
will be delighted to
choose for himself among the 260 articles
on sports and pastimes; and the analysis
of this department of the Britannica, in
Part 6 of this Guide, will then be of service.
We may mention here the articles
<span class='sc'>Golf</span> (Vol. 12, p. 219), by H. G.
Hutchinson, golf champion and author of
<i>Hints on Golf</i>; <span class='sc'>Lacrosse</span> (Vol. 16, p. 54);
<span class='sc'>Bowling</span> (Vol. 4, p. 344); <span class='sc'>Rowing</span> (Vol.
23, p. 783), by C. M. Pitman, formerly
stroke of the Oxford University Eight;
<span class='sc'>Model-Yachting</span> (Vol. 18, p. 640);
<span class='sc'>Angling</span>, <i>Methods and Practice</i> (Vol. 2,
p. 24); <span class='sc'>Cricket</span> (Vol. 7, p. 435); <span class='sc'>Archery</span>,
<i>Pastime of</i> (Vol. 2, p. 364), by the
late W. J. Ford. A long list of indoor and
out-door games will be found in the
classified subject-list (Vol. 29, p. 946).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Diverting and Profitable Occupations</div>

<p class='c007'>The aptitude of children for diverting
and often profitable occupations is admirably
fostered by the new Britannica
through many of its very practical articles.
This matter has been discussed
in the last chapter.
In addition it is worthy
of note that an
ingenious boy could
learn to make and
set up a sun-dial with the help of <span class='sc'>Dial
and Dialling</span> (Vol. 8, p. 149), by Hugh
Godfray; and could experiment and
amuse himself with a <span class='sc'>Camera Lucida</span> or
a <span class='sc'>Camera Obscura</span> (Vol. 5, p. 104), from
the articles written by Charles J. Joly,
late Astronomer Royal of Ireland; while
even a younger child could quickly learn
to tie any kind of a knot from <span class='sc'>Knot</span>
(Vol. 15, p. 871), with 54 illustrations, by
P. G. Tait, the famous British physicist.
All the crafts that produce objects of
household utility are practically taught
in articles by experts, so that the Britannica
is a complete guide to the use of
every kind of tool.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reading for Girls</div>

<p class='c007'>In the field of girls’ occupations there
is in the Britannica
much material that
serves to give knowledge
of the best
methods of home making.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>A great number of articles for girls’
reading will be found among those named
in the chapter For Women.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>In these days parents, and especially
mothers, are devoting more and more
time to the study of child development.
The importance and value of intelligent
sympathetic guidance in everything a
child does—and every active child strives
to do something—has been fully realized.
The chief problem before the parent is,
therefore, to have at hand some ready
means of meeting every expression of a
child’s interests, every indication of budding
talents. A short experience with
the new Britannica will show this to be
one of its many valuable functions.
Children do not need to be driven to the
volumes. They need only to be made
acquainted with them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXIII<br> <span class='c014'>SOME QUESTIONS CHILDREN SOMETIMES ASK, AND SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK CHILDREN</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A child gains a great part of its
knowledge by asking questions,
and he should be encouraged to
ask them. But parents often find the
child’s questions, even those about the
objects he sees every day, so difficult to
answer, that he is told “not to bother.”
With the new Encyclopaedia Britannica
at hand, there is hardly any intelligent
question that cannot be answered after a
glance at the Index and at the page to
which it refers the reader. Again, there
is no better way at once of amusing and
instructing the child than to ask him questions
and help him find his way to the
answers. Here are a few questions: some
of the kind that a child might ask, and
some that may be put to a child. The
Britannica supplies interesting answers
to all of them, and some of these answers
are given here.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What makes people snore?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The answer, found at once by referring
to “snoring” in the Index, is that the
cause is breathing through the mouth,
which makes the soft palate vibrate.
When the child is told this, it should also
be told what the Britannica says about
mouth-breathing being a dangerous habit
for children to form, as it often leads to
sore throats.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>How does one ant tell another to go to
work?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>By patting it with its feelers. The
article <span class='sc'>Ant</span>, by Professor Carpenter, will
supply you with stories to tell children
as fascinating as any fairy tale.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What makes the colours of sunset?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Dust. If it were not for the dust
floating in the air, we should lose not
only the brilliant sunsets but the glorious
cloud scenery as well, and there
would be no twilight. Furthermore, all
the moisture in the air, which now condenses
on the particles of floating dust,
would settle on our clothes and on the
walls of our rooms. You will find many
other curious facts in the article <span class='sc'>Dust</span>,
by John Aitken, who invented the
machine for counting the particles of
dust in the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>How does the brightness of moonlight
compare with that of sunlight?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Most people would guess that sunlight
is twenty, or, at most, fifty times
as strong; yet it is really half a million
times stronger. The article <span class='sc'>Moon</span>, by
Dr. Simon Newcomb, is full of such
curious information and of delightful
pictures.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why did the Israelites in bondage need
straw to put in their bricks, although we
do not use it in ours?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Brick</span> tells you that their
bricks were made of Nile mud, which
would not bind without something to
hold it together.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>When sea-water freezes, does the salt go
into the ice?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Only one-fifth of it, the article <span class='sc'>Ice</span>
says.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Are you sure you like the taste of vanilla?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>This is an excellent puzzle to put to a
bright child. The curious answer, found
in the article <span class='sc'>Taste</span>, is that vanilla, like
onions and some other substances which
we think have strong flavors, really has
no taste at all. We smell them as we eat
them, and therefore we imagine we taste
them. This you can prove to a child
by blindfolding it, while its nose is
firmly closed, holding a slice of onion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>and a slice of apple near its open mouth,
and touching its tongue first with one
and then with the other.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What is a beaver’s favourite food?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Of all unlikely things—water-lilies!
This, and other things that will delight
children, you will find in the article
<span class='sc'>Beaver</span>, by Richard Lydekker, the
famous naturalist.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why is it harder to guess the width of
a river than to guess the width of a field
as wide?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Vision</span> will tell you.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why are new-born babies’ eyes often
slate-blue, for a time?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Eye</span> will tell you.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why is not spiders’ silk manufactured?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately, although the silk is of
the finest quality, quite equal to the
silkworm’s, the spiders are such fierce
cannibals that each one would have to
be kept in a separate box, and this would
make the silk too costly. The article
<span class='sc'>Spiders</span>, by R. I. Pocock, superintendent
of the London Zoological Gardens,
also tells you how spiders make their
way through the air to islands in the
sea; how the wolf-spider builds a nest
with a hinged door, and how the common
pond-spider builds his thimble-shaped
house under water and fills it with air
by swimming down to it, time after
time, on each trip taking down a tiny
bubble of air.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why do not animals that sleep all
through the winter starve to death?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Because they live on the fat they have
put on during the summer, as the article
<span class='sc'>Hibernation</span> explains.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why could not the Norsemen who visited
America in the 11th century found permanent
settlements?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The natives were hostile and the
Norsemen had no firearms. The wonderful
story of the first voyages to
America is told in the article <span class='sc'>Vinland</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>How can you tell how far away a flash
of lightning is?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Sound travels so much more slowly
than light does, that if the flash is a mile
away you see it five seconds before you
hear the report; so by counting the
seconds you can measure the distance.
The Index, under “Lightning: distance”
refers you to the article <span class='sc'>Sound</span>, by Professor
Poynting.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why does your hair stand on end when
you are frightened?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Skin</span>, by Professor Parsons,
will tell you about this curious
action of the muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why do we count by tens?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Because people began by counting on
their fingers and thumbs, and when they
got to ten they had to begin again.
Some tribes used to make twenty their
basis for counting, adding in their toes.
The article <span class='sc'>Arithmetic</span> tells you this;
and a newspaper critic said of this article
that he was amazed to find it one of the
most readable things in the Britannica.
The truth is that there are no subjects
that are dull in themselves. There is a
dull way of treating them, and there is
also the Britannica way, which is to show
you <i>how things came to be as they are</i>.
That is why children are delighted when
“Britannica time” comes, the hour when
the parent sits down by the bookcase
and tells them true stories out of the
volumes and shows them the exquisite
pictures.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Are men or women oftener stammerers?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Stammering</span>, which tells
you that men are much oftener afflicted
than women, is one that all parents
should read. If a child’s speech is carefully
watched, the first trouble of this
kind may sometimes be checked before
it becomes a habit.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why does a room look smaller with red
than with violet wall-paper?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Read the article <span class='sc'>Vision</span> and you will
understand this and many other curious
facts about the way our eyes do their
work. Furthermore, you will be reminded
that slight defects in a child’s
sight should be noticed and treated by
an oculist before permanent harm has
been done.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span><i>Why is winter colder than summer?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Simply because the sun’s rays, coming
aslant instead of from overhead, travel
through more miles of air and are thus
robbed of much of their heat before they
reach us. The polar regions actually
get more hours of sunlight in a year than
we get in the United States, more even
than there are at the equator, but the
sun is never high above the horizon at
the poles.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Can a snake cross a frozen pond?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>No, nor move on any other smooth
surface, as the article <span class='sc'>Snakes</span> shows.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>How long was Abraham Lincoln at
school?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Less than a year in all, as shown by
the article <span class='sc'>Lincoln, Abraham</span>, by J. G.
Nicolay (Lincoln’s private secretary) and
C. C. Whinery. But although he could
not get much teaching, he read over and
over again every book he could get
hold of.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here are a few questions without the
answers; but the numbers after each
question show the volume and page
of the Britannica where each answer
can be found:</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What makes blood clot?</i> (Vol. 4, p. 81.)</p>

226).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>How do trappers prepare valuable fur-skins
so as to preserve them until they get
to market?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The skins are simply dried in the air,
as stated in the article <i>Fur</i>, which was
written by the head of a great wholesale
fur business.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>How does the amount of air in a room
spoiled by an ordinary gas-burner, or a
small reading-lamp, compare with the
amount spoiled by a man’s breathing?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The gas burner or the lamp spoils four
times as much air, as shown in the article
<span class='sc'>Ventilation</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What part of your weight is blood?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>One-twentieth. (Vol. 27, p. 939).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What domestic animal is oftenest born
with only one eye?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The pig. (Vol. 18, p. 743).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Which covers the more space, the United
States (without Alaska) or Europe?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Europe. (Vol. 27, p. 612, and Vol. 9,
p. 907.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>If you looked at the moon all night every
night, how soon would you have seen all
its surface?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Never. Four-tenths of it can never be
seen from the earth. (Vol. 18, p. 803.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What was the great difference between
the destruction of Pompeii and that of
Herculaneum?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Pompeii was covered by ashes and
Herculaneum by mud. (Vol. 22, p. 50,
and Vol. 13, p. 342.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why do not high mountains, where
more snow falls than melts, keep growing
higher?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Because pressure forces the snow,
changed into ice, to descend in the form
of glaciers, as explained in the article
<span class='sc'>Glacier</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Who wrote to George Washington, on
behalf of a number of officers in the United
States army, asking him to make himself
king of the United States?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Col. Lewis Nicola. The article <span class='sc'>Washington,
George</span>, by Professor MacDonald
of Brown University, gives you
the words of Washington’s indignant
reply.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span><i>How deep has anyone ever dived in
diver’s dress?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Divers</span> tells you: 210 feet.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>In baseball, how is a fielding-record
calculated?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>To get the fielder’s average, you divide
the number of chances he has made the
most of by the total number of chances
he has had. (Vol. 3, p. 461.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>How tall must a giant be?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Seven feet, to be properly called a
giant. (Vol. 18, p. 741).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Where were the first lighthouses built?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>In lower Egypt, as stated in the article
<span class='sc'>Lighthouse</span>, which describes all the
great lighthouses and gives pictures of
the towers and of the wonderful lamps.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>When ships are going through the
Panama Canal, from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, will they be heading to the eastward
or to the westward?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Oddly enough, to the eastward; for
the Isthmus curves so, just where the
canal line lies, that the Pacific end is
much to the eastward of the Atlantic end.
You can see this plainly on the detailed
map in the article <span class='sc'>Panama Canal</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why does a tame rabbit die if it is held
erect for half an hour?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Because the muscles of its abdomen
are so weak that they cannot act as a
belt, as our muscles do, and all the rabbit’s
blood settles below the heart. (Vol.
27, p. 942.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>For what price was Manhattan Island
bought from the Indians in 1626?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>For $24 worth of goods, as shown in
the article <span class='sc'>New York</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why do people, when they are in the
polar regions, seldom catch cold?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Because colds are caused by microbes
and there are very few microbes in places
so far from any masses of people, as you
can see from the article <span class='sc'>Climate</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>If North America were spread out on
the surface of the moon, what share of the
moon’s surface would it cover?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>About four-sevenths. (Vol. 18, p. 805,
and Vol. 19, p. 764.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Which is the greater: the highest mountain’s
height or the deepest sea’s depth?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The sea’s depth, which is 31,614 feet;
while Mt. Everest is 29,002 feet high.
(Vol. 19, p. 973, and Vol. 10, p. 7.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Of what use are the hairs on a caterpillar?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Like the bristles on a dog-collar, they
keep an enemy from biting him. (Vol. 6,
p. 733.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Why do you twist yourself into an uncomfortable
position when you have a pain?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Because instinct teaches you that discomfort
will help you by partially taking
your attention away from the pain. (Vol.
22, p. 587.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What warm-blooded creature has the
longest average life?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Man, except possibly the whale; but
not the elephant, as is generally believed.
The article <span class='sc'>Longevity</span> tells how long all
kinds of animals live.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What mistake about American history
is caused in our minds by the celebration
of the Fourth of July?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The belief that the Declaration of
Independence was signed on the 4th of
July. Congress did not order it to be
engrossed for signature until July 19th.
The article <span class='sc'>Independence, Declaration
of</span>, also shows that the most important
day was July 2nd, when Congress
adopted the Resolution of Independence.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you look up the answers to these
questions, in the Britannica, you will
incidentally learn, from the articles to
which you turn, a great many things that
will be of practical use to you in every-day
life. For whether you turn to the
volumes because you want only a single
fact, or because you want to learn all
about some important subject—or even
because you merely want to pass a
pleasant hour—you always get from
them far more than you had hoped to
find.</p>

</div>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>An Intimate Book</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The old idea of an encyclopaedia as
a remote book, distant from every-day
needs and the real public
questions of the day, and to be consulted
only for information
about ancient history
and medieval philosophy,
was a wrong one.
It was wrong <i>in theory</i>, if an encyclopaedia
is to be a live and valuable book. And it
was wrong <i>in practice</i>. It is not the
case with the new Britannica. For the
Britannica is full of information about
current public questions; and even its
treatment of the past, remote or near, is
from a fresh and modern view-point, and
is of the utmost value as throwing the
light of history on the problems of modern
politics and every-day life. The
spirit of to-day is an intensely wide-awake
and inquisitive one, and people are no
longer willing to believe that “whatever
is, is right”—much less that a thing is
right because it <i>has been</i>, no matter how
long. Indeed the very phrase “has been”
as now used in the vernacular implies the
outworn, the discarded. The Britannica,
a book for intimate use on the questions
of the day, is a record <i>of what is</i>, as well
as of what has been, and of the great
changes, the constant flux, of the past and
of the present.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sociology</div>

<p class='c007'>One of our symptoms of health is the
development of a social sense, or, better,
a social conscience. This is due in no
small degree to the work
of Herbert Spencer in
founding a new science,
called by him Sociology. For an inspiring
and stimulating starting-point for the
study in the Britannica of the great social
and political questions of the day let the
reader study the article <span class='sc'>Sociology</span> (Vol.
25, p. 322), by Benjamin Kidd, who
wrote <i>Social Evolution</i>, and <i>Principles of
Western Civilization</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Education</div>

<p class='c007'>Evolution, sociology, Spencerian psychology
and the closer relation of the
state to the individual are all important
factors in the educational
changes of the last
few years; and their
study is indispensable to a clear understanding
of the great questions of education.
A more concrete study may be
based on the article <span class='sc'>Education</span> (Vol. 8,
p. 951) and particularly the part on education
in the United States by Nicholas
Murray Butler, president of Columbia
University. An elaborate course of reading
on education is given in another chapter
of this Guide <i>For Teachers</i>. But it
may be well to call attention here to the
fact that there are in the articles on individual
states sections on the educational
system of each state; and in the separate
articles on each city similar descriptions
of schools in those cities; and also that
either in the article on the city or town in
which it is situated, or in a separate article
there is an estimate, a description,
and a historical sketch of each of the
great universities and colleges of the
country. This information is not merely
of value if one wishes to understand in a
general way the trend of education, but
of particular interest to one who is choosing
the school best adapted to a special
need. In the same way there are articles
on other great educational institutions—for
example a general article on <span class='sc'>Museums
of Science</span> (Vol. 19, p. 64) and one
on <span class='sc'>Libraries</span> (Vol. 16, p. 545), as well as
articles on such special institutions as the
Smithsonian, or treatment of them in the
article on the places where the institution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>is—as in the article on Washington
for the Library of Congress, the article on
New York City for the Metropolitan Museum,
etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Defectives and Their Training</div>

<p class='c007'>But government, particularly in America,
besides taking a direct interest and
responsibility in the education of its
youth, has begun
within the last few
years to assume the
task of uplifting
those of its citizens who are below the
normal. Modern methods of dealing with
criminals and of caring for defectives and
the insane are based on a principle entirely
different from that which obtained
50, or even 20, years ago. The whole
article <i>Insanity</i> (Vol. 14, p. 597) might
well be read as a preliminary to a study of
this topic, since it treats of idiocy and imbecility
as well as of the more violent
forms of mental disorder, and since it
treats them all as forms of disease—the
basis of the modern method of treatment
which has substituted the hospital and
the school for the mere place of detention.
In particular, however, the last part of
this article dealing with <i>Hospital Treatment</i>
should be studied. It is by Dr.
Frederick Peterson, the American specialist,
and it describes the improved conditions
of modern asylums. “Physical restraint
is no longer practised.... The
general progress of medical science in all
directions has been manifested in the department
of psychiatry by improved
methods of treatment, in the way of
sleep-producing and alleviating drugs,
dietetics, physical culture, hydrotherapy
and the like. There are few asylums now
without pathological and clinical laboratories....
The colony scheme has been
successfully adopted by the state of New
York at the Craig Colony for Epileptics
at Sonyea and elsewhere.... Many
asylums have, as it were, thrown off detached
cottages for the better care of certain
patients.... But the ideal system
is that of the psychopathic hospital and
the colony for the insane.” It is with the
“colony” plan that Dr. Peterson’s name
is intimately connected, especially in New
York state. In the Britannica article on
New York state there is a full treatment
(Vol. 19, p. 601) of the state’s charitable
institutions, including its hospitals for
the insane, the Craig Colony already
mentioned, the Letchworth Village custodial
asylum for epileptics and feeble-minded,
and other institutions of the
same kind. And in the same way the
system in each state is described in the
separate article on that state with special
attention to the peculiar features in its
administration of its hospitals and schools
for insane and imbeciles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Blind</div>

<p class='c007'>There has been a similar change in the
education of the blind and the deaf—or
rather education is now provided for these
classes, whereas they
formerly received none
at all. And this education
is coming under state control and,
once under governmental supervision, is
being transferred from departments in
charge of penal or charitable institutions
to the department of public schools. For
the most striking instances of what has
been accomplished by improved systems
of training under private supervision see
the articles on <span class='sc'>Samuel Gridley Howe</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 837), the great teacher of the
blind at the Perkins Institution for the
Blind in Boston; on his blind and deaf
pupil, <span class='sc'>Laura Bridgman</span> (Vol. 4, p. 559),
and on <span class='sc'>Helen Adams Keller</span> (Vol. 15, p.
718), another and even more remarkable
blind and deaf student, whose education,
coming as a product of a new sociology,
has made her a most efficient social helper
and social worker.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these articles the student should
go to <i>Blindness</i> (Vol. 4, p. 59), by Sir
Francis J. Campbell, principal of the
Royal Normal College for the Blind, Norwood,
London; an article equivalent in
length to 40 pages of this Guide. Its author,
the founder of the college, is himself
a blind man, who, born in Tennessee,
in 1832, and educated at the Nashville
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>school, and afterwards in music at Leipzig
and Berlin, had from 1858 to 1869
been associated with Dr. Howe at the
Perkins Institution, Boston, and was
knighted in 1909 for his services to the
education of the blind. The part of his
article dealing with the education of the
blind is, therefore, doubly valuable and
interesting. The main topics with which
it deals are: early training—other senses
of the blind not <i>naturally</i> sharper than
those of the seeing, but developed by
cultivation of hearing and touch from
early childhood; physical training to increase
the average of vitality; mental
training; early manual training; choice of
occupation; piano-forte tuning; musical
training; deaf-mutes should not be educated
with the blind as their needs are so
different; blind boys and blind girls
should not be taught together, as coeducation
promotes intermarriage, which
is a calamity. The remainder of the article
deals with types and books for the
blind, appliances for educational work,
employment, and biographical matter,
with a list of prominent blind people. See
also, for literary men who were blind, the
articles on <span class='sc'>John Milton</span>, <span class='sc'>William H.
Prescott</span>, and <span class='sc'>Philip Bourke Marston</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Deaf</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Deaf and Dumb</span> (Vol. 7, p. 880) is by
the Rev. Arnold Hill Payne, chaplain to
the Oxford Diocesan Mission to the deaf
and dumb, late normal
fellow of the National
Deaf Mute College,
Washington, D. C., and author of many
books on the subject. He points out the
mistaken use of the word “dumb”—“In
the case of the deaf and dumb, as these
words are generally understood, dumbness
is merely the result of ignorance in the use
of the voice, this ignorance being due to
deafness.” After discussing causes of deafness,
the condition of the deaf in childhood,
their natural language, which the contributor
thinks is “sign” rather than purely
oral, and their social status, he deals with
education of the deaf, giving an elaborate
historical account including the “oral”
revival in Germany and the work in the
United States of Dr. Thomas Hopkins
Gallaudet—see also the separate article on
him and his two sons (Vol. 11, p. 416)—and
of the National Deaf-Mute College
at Washington, D. C. (on which see also
the article <span class='sc'>Washington</span>, D. C.). This
interesting article closes with a section on
the blind-deaf, telling the story of several
remarkable cases in England less well-known
and more recent than Laura
Bridgman or Helen Keller.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Psychology</div>

<p class='c007'>This chapter began with a reference to
the article on <span class='sc'>Sociology</span> with the recommendation
that it be used as a basis for
the study of present-day
problems. The
reader will often have
heard vague allusions to sociology, and
his reading this article in the Britannica
will certainly sharpen and define
his own idea of the meaning and the
value of the science. Has he not heard
much oftener of psychology, and heard it
mentioned as if it were some sort of magic
spell to charm away many of the difficulties
of our modern complex world? But
has he a full comprehension of the meaning
of psychology and of the knowledge
newly gained in regard to the “psychology
of the senses”? The corrective for any
vagueness of ideas about psychology is
best found in the article <span class='sc'>Psychology</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 547) by Professor James
Ward, whose articles for the Britannica
have been reprinted and used as text-books
in schools and colleges all over the
country. Put in a few words, the lesson
of psychology is that the senses, sensations,
thoughts and feelings, which, even
when they are our own, we too often
speak of as if they were things apart and
independent, are subject to certain natural
laws in much the same way as are
the forces treated by the science of physics.
The reader who would study the
subject of psychology in the Britannica
should make use of the analysis of many
articles in the chapter in this Guide <i>For
Teachers</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Crime</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>As with general education, special education
of defectives, state training of
feeble-minded, and restraint of the insane,
so with the state’s
attitude toward the criminal
there has been in recent
years a great change which is still
working toward full fruition, so that
prison administration, children’s courts,
delinquency, probation, etc., are live topics
of interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as the whole new science of sociology
was based by Spencer on biology and
on the Darwinian theory of evolution, so
in this field of delinquency a “science”
has been devised called criminology by
its “inventor” Cesare Lombroso. The
article <span class='sc'>Lombroso</span> (Vol. 16, p. 936) in the
Britannica criticizes his theories as showing
“an exaggerated tendency to refer all
mental facts to biological causes.” His
theory of a criminal type points to a
“practical reform&#160;... a classification of
offenders, so that the born criminal may
receive a different kind of punishment
from the offender who is tempted into
crime.” The article <span class='sc'>Criminology</span> (Vol.
7, p. 464), by Major Arthur Griffiths, Inspector
of Prisons, should be read carefully.
It lists the supposed criminal
traits as follows:</p>

<p class='c020'>Various brain and cerebral anomalies; receding
foreheads; massive jaws, prognathous
chins; skulls without symmetry;
ears long, large and projecting; noses rectilinear,
wrinkles strongly marked, even in
the young and in both sexes, hair abundant
on the head, scanty on the cheeks and chin;
eyes feline, fixed, cold, glassy, ferocious;
bad repellent faces.... Other peculiarities
are:—great width of the extended arms,
extraordinary ape-like agility; left-handedness
as well as ambi-dexterism; obtuse
sense of smell, taste and sometimes of
hearing, although the eyesight is superior to
that of normal people.... So much for the
anatomical and physiological peculiarities
of the criminal. There remain the psychological
or mental characteristics, so far as
they have been observed. Moral insensibility
is attributed to him, a dull conscience
that never pricks and a general freedom
from remorse. He is said to be generally
lacking in intelligence, hence his stupidity,
the want of proper precautions, both before
and after an offence, which leads so
often to his detection and capture. His
vanity is strongly marked and shown in
the pride taken in infamous achievements
rather than personal appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although Major Griffiths thinks that
criminality is oftener due to environment
than to congenital defects, he closes his
article with this estimate of what has
been accomplished by Lombroso and his
followers:</p>

<p class='c020'>The criminologists have strengthened the
hands of administrators, have emphasized
the paramount importance of child-rescue
and judicious direction of adults, have
held the balance between penal methods,
advocating the moralizing effect of open-air
labour as opposed to prolonged isolation,
and have insisted upon the desirability
of indefinite detention for all who have
obstinately determined to wage perpetual
war against society by the persistent perpetration
of crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Crime</span> (Vol. 7, p. 447) is
full of interesting statistics and facts. It
tells us that “the growth of criminals is
greatly stimulated where people are badly
fed, morally and physically unhealthy,
infected with any forms of disease and
vice,” and after proving by the records
of various countries that men everywhere
are more addicted to crime than
are women, ends with this statement:
“It has been well said that women are
less criminal according to the figures, because
when a woman wants a crime committed
she can generally find a man to do
it for her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Other important articles on the subject
are <span class='sc'>Deportation</span> (Vol. 8, p. 56) and
<span class='sc'>Prison</span> (Vol. 22, p. 361). For English
prison reforms, see also the article on
<span class='sc'>John Howard</span> and that on <span class='sc'>Elizabeth
Fry</span>, with an outline of the growth in
Pennsylvania and New York (Auburn
and Sing Sing), of the method of solitary
confinement and of its adoption in England,
and of the development in New
York (see also the article on <span class='sc'>Elmira</span> for
the work of Zebulon R. Brockway), and
in Massachusetts (Concord), of distinct
and different treatment for first offenders.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Alcohol</div>

<p class='c007'>If a respectable citizen of a century ago
could return to earth he could not fail to
be greatly surprised at dinner, whether
in a private home or in a
hotel, to see how much less
alcoholic beverages are used,
how much lighter they are, and how
much more common are other drinks. If
he “returned” to certain parts of the
United States he would find that he
could get no alcohol except on a doctor’s
prescription stating the reason why the
patient needed it, and he would learn that
such a prescription could be filled only
once, and then only by a registered pharmacist
of good character. No matter to
what place he came back, he would find a
constant interference with or supervision
of the manufacture, sale and consumption
of alcoholic liquors on the part of the
government. He would probably wonder
why the state should interfere with private
and personal liberty in such matters.
We have already pointed out that the
state now <i>does</i> interfere, and that this is
one of the distinguishing marks of the
government of the day. For information
on this particular form of interference,
its prevalence, its necessity, and its advisability,
the student may confidently
turn to the Britannica. The hygienic side
of the question is outlined in the chapter
of this Guide on <i>Health and Disease</i>. The
social or sociological side claims our attention
here. Read the article <span class='sc'>Drunkenness</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 601), and for the relation
between alcohol and mental disease,
the section <i>Toxic Insanity</i> (Vol. 14, p.
609) in the article on <span class='sc'>Insanity</span> already
mentioned, and also <span class='sc'>Neuropathology</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 429); then the article <span class='sc'>Inebriety,
Law of</span> (Vol. 14, p. 409); that on
<span class='sc'>Liquor Laws</span> (Vol. 16, p. 759), with a
special section referring to the United
States, which deals with local prohibition,
state prohibition, public dispensaries,
and taxation; and for a general and
elaborate summary of the whole question
the article <span class='sc'>Temperance</span> (Vol. 26, p. 578)
equivalent to about 50 pages of this
Guide, by Dr. Arthur Shadwell, author of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span><i>Drink, Temperance and Legislation</i>. In
the section on the <i>Use and Abuse of Alcohol</i>
Dr. Shadwell summarizes the results
of modern scientific investigation of
the abuse in its bearings upon crime,
poverty, insanity, mortality, longevity,
and heredity.</p>

<p class='c007'>In such articles as those on <span class='sc'>Theobald
Mathew</span> (“Father Mathew”) (Vol. 17,
p. 886), <span class='sc'>Neal Dow</span> (Vol. 8, p. 456), <span class='sc'>John
B. Gough</span> (Vol. 12, p. 282), and <span class='sc'>Frances
E. Willard</span> (Vol. 28, p. 658) the reader
will find biographies relating to the temperance
movement; and in the separate
articles on states there is information
about state prohibition, local option, and
the state dispensary system.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Heredity and Eugenics</div>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Shadwell’s remarks on the relation
of alcoholism to heredity may remind us
that the very word “heredity” would
seem strange to the typical man of a century
ago, whose return to life we have
imagined. We should be no more shocked
by the occasional crudeness of his intimate
and excited phraseology than he
would be at our frankness in discussing
even in mixed company such subjects as
birth, reproduction, sexual morality, the
social evil and the white slave trade.
The growth of interest in these topics
may be traced in part to Darwin, Huxley
and Mendel, to what they did to make
biology a science. Read in the Britannica
the interesting story, in the article <span class='sc'>Mendelism</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 115), of the investigations
of Gregor Mendel, Abbot of
Brünn, in his cloister garden, in crossing
peas and classifying the inheritance of
peculiarities. Then read the articles
<span class='sc'>Heredity</span> (Vol. 13,
p. 530), by Prof.
Chalmers Mitchell,
and <span class='sc'>Hybridism</span> (Vol.
14, p. 26), by the
same contributor, and turn to the articles
<span class='sc'>Eugenics</span> (Vol. 9, p. 855) and <span class='sc'>Sir Francis
Galton</span> (Vol. 11, p. 427), for an account
of the attempt to found a practical
science to improve the breed of men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Especially within the last few years
has the public conscience been aroused
on the white slave traffic and prostitution,
both in Great Britain and the United
States, and particularly in the great
cities, where this form of vice, if left under
the jurisdiction of the police, gives
rise to a singularly dangerous form of
corruption and to the general disrepute
of the defenders of public safety. The
many important aspects of the subject,
which need not be rehearsed here, are to
be found in Dr. Shadwell’s article <span class='sc'>Prostitution</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 457) and Dr. Edmund
Owen’s article <span class='sc'>Venereal Diseases</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 983).</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the remedies most commonly
suggested for the evils of prostitution in
general and of the white slave trade in
particular is a minimum wage. Dr. Shadwell’s
article on prostitution gives “excessively
laborious and ill-paid work” as
only one of many secondary causes for
women’s taking to a life of evil repute.
Indolence, love of excitement, dislike of
restraint, and abnormal sexual appetite,
he counts as primary causes; and among
secondary causes he names the difficulty
of finding employment; harsh treatment
at home, promiscuous living among the
overcrowded poor; overcrowding in factories;
the example of luxury, self-indulgence
and loose manners set by the
wealthy; demoralizing literature and
amusements; and the arts of profligate
men. But the subject of wages is an important
one in itself, and as an introduction
to the study of the labour question,
it may well be taken up here, even if
the efficacy of minimum-wage laws, or of
any legislation, in producing a higher
sexual morality has been exaggerated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wages and Labour</div>

<p class='c007'>Read the article <span class='sc'>Wages</span> (Vol. 28, p.
229, equivalent to 20 pages of this Guide),
by Joseph Shield Nicholson, professor of
political economy at
Edinburgh University.
The difficulty
of an exact definition,
and, specifically, of one that distinguishes
between “wages” and “profits,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>leads the author to adopt as the best the
definition of Gen. Francis A. Walker, the
American economist, “the reward of
those who are employed in production
with a view to the profit of their employers
and are paid at stipulated rates.”
The distinction between a nominal and
real wage is based on the difference between
the money value and the purchasing
value of the wage as affected by variation
in the cost of living. Irregularity of
employment and other elements of uncertainty,
such as liability to accident or to
occupational diseases, are factors to be
considered in estimating real wages.
Professor Nicholson discusses the wage-fund
theory, corrects it by Adam Smith’s
observation that wages are paid from the
product of labour; and treats “relative”
wages, the state-regulation of wages
(which he does not consider feasible); poor
relief in aid of wages; factory legislation;
trade unions; the effects of machinery on
wages; and the progress of the working-classes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Labour Legislation</div>

<p class='c007'>The subject of factory legislation brings
us back to the general topic of “state interference
with private matters” as the
old school of political scientists would
have called it. Two treatises in the Britannica
are important for the study of this
subject—the general
article <span class='sc'>Labour
Legislation</span> (Vol.
16, p. 7), equivalent
to 70 pages of this Guide, by Adelaide
Mary Anderson, principal lady inspector
of factories to the British Home Office, and
Carroll D. Wright, late U. S. Commissioner
of Labor; and the article <span class='sc'>Employers’
Liability and Workmen’s Compensation</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 356), which is of
peculiar interest now that in the United
States recent laws in regard to employers’
liability and workmen’s compensation
have shown a change in legislative
theory and practice. Statutes of this
kind have been passed by the legislatures
of several states where nothing of the
sort would have been attempted a generation
ago, although legislatures have always
been readier than courts to approve
radical laws, and have been far more
readily influenced by popular sentiment.
After their passage they have in some
states been held unconstitutional, and in
other states the highest court has recognized
them as valid; the decisions perhaps
depending to some extent on the
attitude of the court toward the opposed
claims of capital and labour. Here as
elsewhere the student should remember
that much information of a local character
is to be found in the articles on
different states of the Union. The article
<span class='sc'>Labor Day</span> (Vol. 16, p. 6) describes an
official recognition of the claims of labour
in the United States.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Organized Labour</div>

<p class='c007'>On labour organizations and their
work see the articles: <span class='sc'>Trade Unions</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 140), and particularly the
section <i>Economic
Effects of Trade
Unionism</i>, and the
section on trade
unions in the United States, by Carroll
D. Wright, late U. S. Commissioner of
Labor, who deals with such topics as
railway brotherhoods, national unions,
the “International,” Knights of Labor,
American Railway Union, federations of
labour, especially the American Federation
of Labor, and estimated strength of
trade unions. For the earlier history of
trade unions or similar organizations see

Dr. Carroll D. Wright, who describes,
among others, the Homestead strike of
1892, the Pullman strike of 1894, the steel
strike of 1901, and the coal strike of
1902. For these and other strikes see the

<span class='sc'>Vagrancy</span> (Vol. 27, p. 837).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Immigration</div>

<p class='c007'>Closely connected with the American
labour problems, since growing American
industries demand a supply of workmen
that cannot be filled
by natural increase
in the population, is
the question of immigration. The article
<span class='sc'>Migration</span> (Vol. 18, p. 427) is divided
into two parts, the second dealing with
migration in zoology. The first section,
dealing with emigration and immigration
and internal migration of populations, is
for the most part by Richmond Mayo-Smith,
late professor of political economy
and social science in Columbia University,
New York City. It is appropriate
that the subject should be treated by an
American and with special attention to
the United States, since this country
owes its origin to an immigration three
centuries ago; as the presence of many
recent immigrants puts a strain on our
powers of assimilation and gives rise to
other serious problems; and as internal
migrations are markedly affecting social
conditions. In a preliminary historical
sketch the author deals with: prehistoric
migrations in search of booty, through the
desire of the stronger to take possession
of the lands of the weaker, or by pressure
of population on the food supply; Greek
and Roman colonization; the German
conquest; minor migratory movements
such as the introduction of Flemish
weavers to England and the forced migration
of the Huguenots from France;
the great colonization period after the
discovery of America; and modern migration—characterized
by its magnitude, by
the change of the emigrant’s political
allegiance, and by the circumstance that
it is a movement of “individuals seeking
their own good without state direction or
aid.” In a statistical discussion of immigration
to the United States (Vol. 18, p.
430) there is much valuable information.
“At first the Irish and Germans were
most prominent. Of later years, the
Italians, Czechs, Hungarians and Russians
were numerously represented.”
Immigration to other countries, especially
Canada and South America; the balance
of migration and temporary emigration;
and the effects of migration on the
country “from which” and the country
“to which”—are topics considered in the
article, which also discusses the restriction
of immigration. As to Asiatic immigration
see <span class='sc'>California</span> (especially p.
20, Vol. 5), <span class='sc'>San Francisco</span> (p. 148, Vol.
24), and <span class='sc'>Coolie</span> (Vol. 7, p. 77). See also
the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>, section <i>Population
and Social Conditions</i> (p. 634, Vol.
27), and, in separate articles on states
and larger cities of the United States, the
analysis of foreign-born population, that
of foreign parentage, etc. For instance,
in the article <span class='sc'>Massachusetts</span> (Vol. 17,
p. 854), there is a most interesting account
of the varying sources of immigration
and of the replacing of Irish labour
by Canadians and Italians. Boston is
the second immigrant port of the country.
A large part of the transatlantic immigrants
pass speedily to permanent homes
in the West, but by far the greater part of
the Canadian influx remains there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article on <span class='sc'>New York City</span> (p. 617
of Vol. 19) remarks that</p>

<p class='c020'>there are in New York City more Germans
than in any city of Germany, save Berlin,
and more Irish than in Dublin. There are
many well-defined foreign communities in
the city, such as “Little Italy” about Mulberry
Street, “Chinatown” on Mott, Pell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>and Doyers Streets, the Hebrew quarter
on the upper Bowery and east of it, a
“German Colony” east of Second Avenue
below Fourteenth Street, French quarters
south of Washington Square about Bleecker
Street and on the West Side between
Twentieth and Thirty-fourth Streets; a
Russian quarter near East Broadway, a
“Greek Colony” about Sixth Avenue in
the 40’s, and negro quarters on Thompson
Street and on the West Side in the 50’s,
and there are equally well-defined Armenian
and Arab quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chicago, as the article on that city
shows, is the second largest Bohemian
city in the world, the third Swedish, the
fourth Norwegian, the fifth Polish and
the fifth German.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Negro Problem</div>

<p class='c007'>The Southern states of the Union,
though they have much less immigration
than the North or
West, have a population
problem that is
even more difficult
in some respects—that of the negro.
Many immigrant elements are readily
“amalgamated” or assimilated into the
native local population—by marriage, by
trade, and indeed even by physical environment.
It seems certain, for instance,
that the physical type of the children
of Italian or Hebrew immigrants in
New York City is different from that of
their parents and more like a local type,
even in such respects as the shape and
contour of the head and its ratio of length
to breadth. But the negro does not assimilate
physically or, to any considerable
degree, mentally; and the communities
in America in which he is most plentiful
are so far from eager to assimilate him
that they socially and politically isolate
him. The reader should go to the article
<span class='sc'>Negro</span> (Vol. 19, p. 344), in which there
is a general study of the race by T. Athol
Joyce, assistant in the Department of
Ethnography, British Museum, and a section
on <i>Negroes in the United States</i> by Dr.
Walter Francis Willcox, late chief statistician
U. S. Census Bureau and professor
of social science and statistics, Cornell
University. The magnitude of the negro
problem may be deduced from Professor
Willcox’s remark that the present number
of negroes in the United States “is
greater than the total population of the
United States was in 1820, and nearly as
great as the population of Norway, Sweden
and Denmark.” Birth and mortality
statistics in regard to negroes show that
they are increasing much less rapidly than
whites; but it must be remembered that
there is an absolute increase, that there
is no prospect of the negro problem being
solved by the dying out of the race, and
that even the fact that negroes constitute
a smaller proportion of the population
than formerly does not greatly affect the
problem. There is also much relevant information
of value in the articles on the
Southern states, particularly in the sections
on population, education and government;
and as to education see the
articles <span class='sc'>Tuskegee</span> (Vol. 27, p. 487),
<span class='sc'>Booker T. Washington</span> (Vol. 28, p. 344)
and <span class='sc'>S. C. Armstrong</span> (Vol. 2, p. 591).
See also the article <span class='sc'>Lynch Law</span> (Vol. 17,
p. 169) by Prof. W. L. Fleming of the
Louisiana State University.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Trusts</div>

<p class='c007'>There is a very close relation between
the economic problems connected with
labour and those which have to do with
capital and especially with
capital in its organized and
monopolistic forms. A monopoly
of the supply, sale, or manufacture
of any class of goods was, especially
in England under the Tudors
and Stuarts, a crown grant; and the theory
of patent and copyright law is based
on such grants, as is shown in the articles
<span class='sc'>Monopoly</span> (Vol. 18, p. 733), <span class='sc'>Letters
Patent</span> (Vol. 16, p. 501), and <span class='sc'>Patents</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 903). On the modern monopoly
which, far from being cherished by
government, is constantly being regulated,
checked or “crushed,” see the article
<span class='sc'>Trusts</span> (Vol. 22, p. 334) by Prof. J.
W. Jenks, formerly of Cornell and now of
New York University, whose treatment
is from the American point of view—the
problem is peculiarly an American one—but
with sections on European experience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>including paragraphs on Great Britain,
Germany, France and Austria.</p>

that are continually presenting
themselves to the mind of every intelligent
citizen, but that are seldom lucidly answered
even by the most intelligent—are:</p>

<p class='c020'>What are trusts? Why are they formed?</p>

<p class='c020'>Why were they not formed before the latter
years of the 19th century?</p>

<p class='c020'>Why can combination be successfully applied
in some industries and not in others?
Why do some industries thrive better under
competition than under combination? Why
are some combinations bound to fail?</p>

<p class='c020'>In what respect has the trust advantages
over the individual competitor?</p>

<p class='c020'>How do trusts benefit by protective tariffs
and by discrimination in rates of transportation?</p>

<p class='c020'>What has been the history of trusts in Europe?</p>

<p class='c020'>The question of most interest to the ordinary
person is: Do trusts raise prices? To
this the Encyclopaedia Britannica answers:
“Experience seems to show, beyond question,
that whenever the combinations are powerful
enough to secure a monopolistic control it has
usually been the policy to increase the prices
above those which obtained during the period
of competition preceding the formation of the
combination.” Besides this increased price,
the evils of combinations are: loss to investors
through promotion and speculation by directors;
loss to wage-earners, corruption of legislatures,
and the suppression of independent
activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most obvious remedies are “more
rigid laws with reference to the methods
of incorporation and to the responsibility
of directors to stockholders and to the
public,” greater publicity and closer government
inspection, and the abolition of
special favours granted by government
and shipping companies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Government Control</div>

<p class='c007'>For American legislation in regard to
trusts see the article <span class='sc'>Interstate Commerce</span>
(Vol. 14, p. 711), equivalent to 10
pages of this Guide,
by Prof. Frank A.
Fetter, formerly of
Cornell and now of
Princeton University. This article shows
the constitutional basis for action by the
Federal government and the power given
to Congress to regulate commerce among
the several states; and it describes the
Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, amended
in 1903 by the Elkins Act, and the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890. See
also in the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>, the
section <i>History</i>, §§ 353, 357, 396 (pp. 725,
726, 733 of Vol. 27).</p>

<p class='c007'>But although there have been great
changes in the relation of government to
the individual in his private and business
life, the extent of practical government
control is still much less than many
theorists would like to see. It is true
that in many countries of Europe railways
are owned and operated by the
state—see p. 826 of Vol. 22, in the article
<span class='sc'>Railways</span>. See also the article <span class='sc'>New
Zealand</span> and the summary of conditions
there (p. 307, Vol. 25), in part as follows:</p>

<p class='c020'>The government owns not only the railways,
but two-thirds of the whole land, letting
it on long leases. It sets a limit to
large estates. It levies a progressive income-tax
and land tax. It has a labour
department, strict factory acts and a law
of compulsory arbitration in labour disputes
(1895). There are old-age pensions
(1898), government insurance of life
(1871) and against fire (1905). Women
have the suffrage, and, partly in consequence,
the restriction of the liquor traffic
is severe. There is a protective tariff, and
Oriental labour is excluded. The success
of the experiment is not yet beyond doubt;
compulsory arbitration, for example, did
not work with perfect smoothness, and was
amended in 1908.... It is fair to
add that the experiment is probably on
too small a scale to show what might happen
in larger countries. New Zealand has
only 100,000 sq. m. of territory and about
one million of inhabitants, mainly rural
and of picked quality. The conditions of
combined isolation and security are not
easily obtained elsewhere. The action of
the state has been in the great majority
of instances rather regulative than constructive.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Socialism, etc.</div>

<p class='c007'>But in general governments have extended
their control more or less along
the conventional lines of law and legislative
theory, and have
not undertaken ownership
and operation—even
in New
Zealand, as we have just seen, public action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>being “rather regulative than constructive.”
See the general article <span class='sc'>Socialism</span>
(Vol. 25, p. 310) and biographies
of those connected with the Socialist
movement, such as Marx, Lassalle, Robert
Owen, Rodbertus, Bebel, Liebknecht,
Jaures, Ballance, William Morris, Edward
Bellamy, and Henry George. On
communism, see the article on that subject,
the biographies of Owen, Saint-Simon,
Fourier, Cabet, etc., and descriptions
of the more important American
communistic experiments in the articles
on Brook Farm, Shakers, Amana, Nauvoo,

Hopedale, etc. For communism merely
as a business scheme see the article <span class='sc'>Co-operation</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 82) and the biographies
of Raiffeisen and Schulze-Delitzsch.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Finance</div>

<p class='c007'>We have now run through the more
strikingly novel public questions of the
day, and we come next to questions which
have been long discussed
and longer recognized as
being within the sphere of
government. The one of these that is
most intimately connected with the economic
problems we have just been discussing
is the subject of public finance and
revenue. On this read the articles <span class='sc'>Finance</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 374), <span class='sc'>Taxation</span> (Vol.
26, p. 458), and <span class='sc'>National Debt</span> (Vol.
19, p. 266); and, on American public
finance, see Vol. 27, p. 654; on Congressional

article dealing with a state of the
Union, the articles <span class='sc'>Gold</span> (Vol. 12,
p. 192), <span class='sc'>Silver</span> (Vol. 25, p. 112), and

(Vol. 12, p. 880), and <span class='sc'>Jay Cooke</span> (Vol. 7,
p. 73).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Tariff</div>

<p class='c007'>Of perennial interest in the field of public
finance is the question of tariff reform.
This is true both in the United States
and in the United Kingdom, but strangely
enough “tariff reform” is
used with absolutely opposite
meanings in the two
countries. Tariff reform in England is
linked with Imperialism and means the
introduction of higher tariffs for protection
of colonial as well as British industries.
In the United States the typical
tariff reformer is usually an opponent of
Imperialism (which, of course, does not
mean the same thing in the two countries),
and tariff reform here involves
lowering duties, doing away with protection,
and, in short, adopting approximately
the very system now in vogue in
the United Kingdom, and the very system
that the followers of Joseph Chamberlain
wish to replace with something
not entirely unlike the American protective
system as it has been since the Civil
War. On this subject see the article
<span class='sc'>Tariff</span> (Vol. 26, p. 422), by the American
economist, F. W. Taussig, professor at
Harvard, the articles <span class='sc'>Protection</span> (Vol.
22, p. 464), by E. J. James, president of
the University of Illinois, and author of
the <i>History of American Tariff Legislation</i>,
and <span class='sc'>Free Trade</span> (Vol. 11, p. 88), by
the Venerable Dr. William Cunningham,
Archdeacon of Ely, and author of <i>The
Growth of English Industry and Commerce</i>;

Great Britain; and the article on <span class='sc'>Joseph
Chamberlain</span> (in particular pp. 816–817
of Vol. 5) for English tariff reform in
politics.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Banking Laws</div>

<p class='c007'>Another topic in public finance of great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>interest at the present moment is the
banking laws,—the interference of government
with banking
and similar business.
Local regulations
in regard to
banking will be found in sections on legislation
and finance in articles on each of
the states of the Union. The article
<span class='sc'>Oklahoma</span> (Vol. 20, p. 57), for example,
contains the following summary of the
first radical state enactment—constitutional
in this case,—providing bank
guarantees:</p>

<p class='c020'>The unique feature of the banking system
(with amendments adopted by the second
legislature becoming effective on the 11th
of June, 1909) is a fund for the guaranty
of deposits. The state banking board levies
against the capital stock of each state
bank and trust company, organized or existing,
under the laws of the state to create
a fund equal to 5% of average daily deposits
other than the deposits of state
funds properly secured. One-fifth of this
fund is payable the first year and one-twentieth
each year thereafter; 1% of the
increase in average deposits is collected
each year. Emergency assessments, not to
exceed 2%, may be made whenever necessary
to pay in full the depositors in an
insolvent bank; if the guaranty fund is
impaired to such a degree that it is not
made up by the 2% emergency assessment,
the state banking board issues certificates
of indebtedness which draw 6% interest
and which are paid out of the assessment.
Any national bank may secure its depositors
in this manner if it so desires. The
bank guarantee law was held to be valid
by the United States Supreme Court in
1908, after the attorney-general of the
United States had decided that it was illegal.</p>

<p class='c007'>More general treatment is to be found
in the articles <span class='sc'>Banks and Banking</span> (Vol.
3, p. 334), <span class='sc'>Savings Banks</span> (Vol. 24, p.
243) and <span class='sc'>Trust Company</span> (Vol. 27, p.
329); and see further the articles listed in
the chapter in this Guide <i>For Bankers
and Financiers</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Insurance</div>

<p class='c007'>Another sphere of private finance over
which government restriction and regulation
has been greatly
extended during the
last few years, is insurance.
The entire subject of insurance
is, moreover, of interest not merely
to the citizen as a member of the body
politic but to the individual as the head
of a family and as an investor for his own
protection in old age. To every one,
therefore, the article <span class='sc'>Insurance</span> (Vol. 14,
p. 656) will be of the utmost value, by
reason of its rare combination of interest
and authority. For a full analysis of this
article and of related topics see the chapter
in this Guide <i>For the Insurance Man</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Legislation and Courts</div>

<p class='c007'>Much of the earlier part of the present
chapter has been devoted to the rapid extension
of governmental control, regulation
and supervision
through legislation.
Interesting and novel
though this is, it is
far less important for an intelligent comprehension
of government than is a careful
study of the foundations and principles
of legislation. Only the specialist
will wish to pursue a complete course in
political science, but every well-informed
citizen of the United States should study
the general powers and functions of national
and state legislatures and courts.
This material is given briefly, lucidly and
critically by the Hon. James Bryce, late
British Ambassador to the United States,
former President of the British Board of
Trade, and author of <i>The American Commonwealth</i>,
in the section <i>Constitution and
Government</i>, article <span class='sc'>United States</span> (Vol.
27, pp. 646–658). Part of this section deals
with the governments of the states, as to
which there is also special information in
the section on government of the article
on each state. Regarding city governments
similar sections will be found in
the articles on the larger cities. For a
full analysis and a list of articles see the
chapter <i>For Lawyers</i> in this Guide. Constitutional
restrictions of all delegated
powers must be continually kept in mind
in the study of the action of legislatures
and courts, and of the questions that
arise in regard to legislation or to court
decisions. Although the legislature represents
the people more or less directly—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>lower house being commonly called
the House of Representatives—and so
has delegated to it from the people the
power of making laws, still, in the Federal
and state constitutions (except those
of a very recent date) there is a system of
checks on every delegated power. The
result is that an act passed by Congress
does not become law without the approval
of the president, nor, in most
states, a local statute without that of the
governor, and—more important—is not
a valid law if the highest Federal Court
(or, if it be a state enactment, the highest
state court) holds it contrary to the
terms of the constitution. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The System
of Checks<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For a summary
of the historical
arguments for
this system of checks
see the section on
the Constitution (Vol. 27, p. 686), in the
article <span class='sc'>United States</span> and such biographical
articles as <span class='sc'>James Madison</span> (Vol.
17, p. 284); <span class='sc'>Alexander Hamilton</span> (Vol.
12, p. 880), and <span class='sc'>Gouverneur Morris</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 869). The working of this
system in nation and state has been
greatly affected by the distinction between
the legislators’ mandate and that of the
judge. Legislators have shorter terms of
service than judges, and especially judges
of the higher courts, and so may be said to
be in much closer and more constant contact
with the people; and the legislator is
bound by what he thinks the people need
and want,—something that is continually
changing. On the other hand, the judge
is bound by the written law, unchanged
and unchangeable except by constitutional
amendments or slightly varying
interpretation of the constitution. The
result has been dissatisfaction with the
courts and with legislatures. The definite
expression of this dissatisfaction is in
constitutional amendments or in new
constitutions, adopted in order that future
action of the courts may more nearly
accord with the present sentiment of the
people. The story of the constitution of
each state in the Union is told, with a
summary of important constitutional
changes, in the section on government of
each article on a separate state. In his
analysis of the state constitutions, Mr.
Bryce says (Vol. 27, p. 647):</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Initiative, Referendum and Recall</div>

<p class='c020'>Comparing the old constitutions with the
new ones, it may be said that the note
of those enacted in the first
thirty or forty years of the
republic was their jealousy
of executive power and their
careful safeguarding of the
rights of the citizen; that of
the second period, from 1820 to the Civil
War (1861–65), the democratization of the
suffrage of institutions generally; that of
the third period (since the war to the present
day), a disposition to limit the powers
and check the action of the legislature, and
to commit power to the hands of the whole
people voting at the polls.</p>

<p class='c007'>And at the close of his treatment of
local government in the United States,
the same authority writes (Vol. 27, p.
651):</p>

<p class='c020'>Several state constitutions now contain
provisions enabling a prescribed number
(or proportion) of the voters in a state or
city to submit a proposition to all the registered
voters of the state (or city) for
their approval. If carried, it takes effect
as a law. This is the Initiative. These
constitutions also allow a prescribed number
of voters to demand that a law passed
by the state legislature, or an ordinance
passed by the municipal authority, be submitted
to all the voters for their approval.
If rejected by them, it falls to the ground.
This is the Referendum. Some cities also
provide in their charters that an official,
including the mayor or a member of the
council, may be displaced from office if, at
a special election held on the demand of a
prescribed number of the city voters, he
does not receive the largest number of
votes cast. This is the Recall. All these
three institutions are in operation in some
Western states and are spreading to some
of the Eastern cities. Their working is observed
with lively interest, for they carry
the principle of direct popular sovereignty
to lengths unprecedented except in Switzerland.
But it is not merely to the faith
of the Western Americans in the people
that their introduction is due. Quite as
much must be ascribed to the want of faith
in the legislature of states and cities, which
are deemed too liable to be influenced by
selfish corporations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with the above reference
to the referendum and initiative in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>Switzerland, see the description of the
Swiss system of continuous control by
the electors (Vol. 26, p. 243).</p>

<p class='c007'>On previous experience, outside the
United States, with the referendum and
the initiative, see the article <span class='sc'>Referendum</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 1), by the Rev. Dr. W. A. B.
Coolidge, an American whose life has
been chiefly spent in, and devoted to the
study of, Switzerland, where the system
was evolved. In the United States the
system was first tried in Oregon, and the
student should read the description in the
article <span class='sc'>Oregon</span> of the legislative department
(Vol. 20, p. 246), which also deals
with the recall of officers. See also under
<span class='sc'>Oklahoma</span> (Vol. 20, p. 59), and the
articles on <span class='sc'>South Dakota</span> and <span class='sc'>Los
Angeles</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Suffrage</div>

<p class='c007'>On suffrage in the United States see p.
647 of Vol. 27, describing the requirements
in different states and pointing out
that “by the Federal Constitution
state suffrage is
also the suffrage for Federal
elections, viz. elections of representatives
in Congress and of presidential electors.”
On representation see the passage on p.
653 of Vol. 27, a portion of which has
been quoted above; and on representation
in state legislatures see p. 647 of Vol.
27 and consult the articles on the separate
states, where in the sections headed
<i>Government</i> there is also supplementary
information about election and ballot
laws. It is interesting to note, in the
articles on Mississippi, Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
Louisiana and Oklahoma, that
these states have practically disfranchised
the negro. For a concrete instance
of the awkward working of the electoral
college, in the choice of the president in
1876, see the article <span class='sc'>Electoral Commission</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 172). On the position of
aliens see the articles <span class='sc'>Allegiance</span> (Vol.
1, p. 689) and <span class='sc'>Naturalization</span> (Vol. 19,
p. 275); and articles on various states.
In the article <span class='sc'>Oregon</span>, for instance (Vol.
20, p. 245), the reader will find that “the
constitution provides that no Chinaman,
not a resident of the state at the time of
the adoption of the constitution, shall
ever hold any real estate or mining claim,
or work any mining claim in the state.”</p>

<p class='c007'>See also, on the whole subject, the articles
<span class='sc'>Ballot</span> (Vol. 3, p. 279); <span class='sc'>Vote</span> (Vol.
28, p. 216); <span class='sc'>Voting Machines</span> (Vol. 28,
p. 217); <span class='sc'>Election</span> (Vol. 9, p. 169); <span class='sc'>Representation</span>
(Vol. 23, especially pp. 112–116,
for proportional voting, second choice
voting, etc.), and <span class='sc'>Women</span> (Vol. 28, p. 782)
for the history of the woman’s suffrage
movement. In that connection it is
curious to note in this article (p. 787)
that, owing to an oversight in the wording
of the first constitution of New Jersey,
women could vote in that state from 1776
to 1807. For any thorough knowledge of
practical, as contrasted with theoretical
representative government in the United
States, the student should read what Mr.
Bryce has to say about <i>Party Government</i>
(Vol. 27, p. 658–660); a large part
of the article on the history of the United
States after the adoption of the Constitution
(Vol. 27, pp. 688–735); articles
on the great parties, <span class='sc'>Federalist</span> (Vol.
10, p. 235), <span class='sc'>Democratic</span> (Vol. 8, p. 2),
and <span class='sc'>Republican</span> (Vol. 23, p. 177); and
the lives of the great party leaders from
Hamilton and Jefferson to McKinley,
Roosevelt, Bryan and Woodrow Wilson.
A fuller outline for the study of United
States history will be found in another
chapter of this Guide, on <i>History of the
United States</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Municipal Government</div>

<p class='c007'>But the Federal government and even
the state governments do not touch any
one of us so closely as does the local government
of our city
and township; and
Mr. Bryce gives (Vol.
27, p. 650) a valuable
criticism of the American system of
local government,—which, in some cities,
indeed, seems a lack of system in the business
sense of that word, and a control of
the government by political parties prone
to corruption, bribery and the granting of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>special privilege. Mr. Bryce dwells on
the over-developed power of the state in
legislating for the cities or other minor
governmental units, and the consequent
activity of local city interests in state and
national politics, but he also points to the
growing tendency of the states to permit
cities to enact their own charters. The
movement to take the city government
out of politics has reached its greatest
force—and its greatest success—in government
by commission.</p>

<p class='c020'>In 1902 the city of Galveston, in Texas,
adopted a new form of municipal government
by vesting all powers in a commission
of five persons, elected by the citizens
on a “general ticket,” one of whom is
mayor and head of the commission, while
each of the others has charge of a department
of municipal administration. A similar
plan, differing in some details, was subsequently
introduced in the city of Des
Moines, in Iowa; and the success which has
attended this new departure in both cities
has led to its adoption in many others, especially,
but not exclusively, in the Western
states.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a fuller account see the articles on
<span class='sc'>Galveston</span> and <span class='sc'>Des Moines</span>, where, as
in other articles on towns and cities, there
is a summary of their government and
particularly of the distinctive features of
local administration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>International Relations</div>

<p class='c007'>What we have said, up to this point,
has all dealt with our country as a self-contained
unit—except that we have
touched on tariffs
and on immigration
and on the treatment
of aliens. In
the article <span class='sc'>Alien</span> (Vol. 1, p. 662) the reader
will find the sentence: “In the United
States the separate state laws largely determine
the status of an alien, but subject
to Federal treaties.” And Mr. Bryce
(Vol. 27, p. 652) characterizes some of
the powers allotted to the national government
“which relate to its action in the
international sphere.” See particularly
Mr. Bryce’s remarks (Vol. 27, p. 656) on
the powers of the president:</p>

<p class='c020'>In time of war or of public disturbance,
however, the domestic authority of the
president expands rapidly. This was
markedly the case during the Civil War.
As commander-in-chief of the army and
navy, and as ‘charged with the faithful execution
of all laws,’ he is likely to assume,
and would indeed be expected to assume,
all the powers which the emergency requires.
In ordinary times the president
may be almost compared to the managing
clerk in a large business establishment,
whose chief function is to select his subordinates,
the policy of the concern being
in the hands of the board of directors. But
when foreign affairs reach a critical stage,
or when disorders within the Union require
Federal intervention, immense responsibility
is then thrown on one who is
both commander-in-chief of the army and
the head of the civil executive. In no European
country is there any personage to
whom the president can be said to correspond.
He may have to exert more authority,
even if he enjoys less dignity, than a
European king. He has powers which are
in ordinary times narrower than those of a
European prime minister; but these powers
are more secure, for instead of depending
on the pleasure of a parliamentary majority,
they run on to the end of his term.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection you should read the

<p class='c020'>Such articles as these tell how peace has
changed from a purely negative condition to
a positive subject of international regulation
and an object of active political effort. They
answer the following concrete questions on the
subject:</p>

<p class='c020'>What was the earliest plan of peace known
to history? What were the Pax Romana, the
“Truce of God,” the “Grand Design” of
Henry IV, and other schemes for the preservation
of peace?</p>

<p class='c020'>What was the greatest deliberate effort ever
made to secure the peace of the world?</p>

and when will the next one be held?</p>

<p class='c020'>How far can disarmament be carried out?</p>

<p class='c020'>What standing-peace agreements have been
executed?</p>

<p class='c020'>What is the history of popular effort for
international peace, and what peace societies

<div class='sidenote'>International Affairs</div>

<p class='c007'>On international affairs of to-day in
which the United States has a special
interest there is a wealth of information in
the Britannica. The
first topic that will
naturally present itself
to the mind of
the reader is the Panama canal. On this
see the article <span class='sc'>Panama Canal</span> (Vol. 20,
p. 666), with a large-scale map, a history
of the project and a description of the
engineering features; and on the politics,
national and international, of the question
of building the canal, the articles
<span class='sc'>Colombia</span>, <span class='sc'>Panama</span>, <span class='sc'>Roosevelt</span>, <span class='sc'>United
States</span>, <i>History</i> (Vol. 27, pp. 730 and
732), <span class='sc'>John Hay</span>, and <span class='sc'>Pauncefote</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our relations with Colombia in connection
with the canal will naturally lead the
student to a general consideration of the
relation of the United States with the
Latin-American countries. Here the
most interesting factor is the Monroe
Doctrine, which has been characterized
“as one of the things that every one
knows about but that few can explain.”
Read the article <span class='sc'>Monroe Doctrine</span> (Vol.
18, p. 738), by Dr. T. S. Woolsey, Professor
of international law, Yale University;
the article <span class='sc'>James Monroe</span> (Vol. 18,
p. 736), and, in the article <span class='sc'>United States</span>,
<i>History</i> § 156 (Vol. 27, p. 695).</p>

<p class='c007'>A second topic in the story of Latin-America
and the United States is Cuba;
and this part of the story has probably
never been told as accurately and interestingly
as in the articles <span class='sc'>Cuba</span> (Vol. 7, p.
594), and <span class='sc'>Havana</span> (Vol. 13, p. 76) in the
Britannica, both by Dr. F. S. Philbrick.</p>

<p class='c007'>American relations with the Orient is a
third subject of importance in the foreign
affairs of the United States; and in this
subject the most interesting topic is Chinese
and Japanese exclusion. On this
see the articles <span class='sc'>California</span>, <span class='sc'>San Francisco</span>,
<span class='sc'>Coolie</span>, and <span class='sc'>United States</span>,
<i>History</i> § 339 (Vol. 27, p. 723). At the
end of the article <span class='sc'>Japan</span> (Vol. 15, p. 156)
there is a section on <i>The Claims of Japan</i>,
by Baron Dairoku Kikuchi, which is of
great interest in this connection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sea-Power</div>

<p class='c007'>The place of the United States as a
world power, we are proud to say, depends
little on its
army or navy—because
of its enormous
latent strength, its commanding
geographical position, etc. But the comparatively
greater importance of navy
over army is now admitted by nearly
every serious thinker—it was the
concrete lesson of the Spanish-American
War of 1898 as it was the point of the
valuable historical essays on sea-power
written before and since that war by the
American naval officer, Rear-Admiral A.
T. Mahan. The American navy and the
navies of the world are matters of interest
to every one—and like all matters of
importance they are to be found treated
in the Britannica.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general see the elaborate articles
<span class='sc'>Navy</span> (Vol. 19, p. 299); <span class='sc'>Sea-Power</span> (Vol.
25, p. 548); and <span class='sc'>Sea, Command of the</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 529); and for a detailed
course of reading on naval history and
theory see the chapter in this Guide <i>For
Naval Officers</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Greater United States</div>

<p class='c007'>The topics just discussed will serve as
an introduction to the study of the Imperial
United States, which may be pursued
in the articles
<span class='sc'>Alaska</span>, <span class='sc'>Hawaii</span>,
<span class='sc'>Philippine Islands</span>,
<span class='sc'>Porto Rico</span>, <span class='sc'>Guam</span>
and <span class='sc'>Cuba</span>, and the articles on the towns
and cities in the outlying possessions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result of reading these articles
will be a determination to know <i>more</i>
about your country, to master its history,
its industries and its commerce as
well as its political conditions.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>It would be absurd, in the full stream
of the 20th century, to imagine that
any of the articles in the new edition
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica can be
either beyond the comprehension of
women or unlikely to interest women.
And since any method of selection is also
a method of elimination, it may be
illogical to suggest that any one class of
articles especially merits their attention.
But the difficulty is purely formal. For
perhaps the greatest victory of the feminist
movement lies in the demonstrated
proposition that women can, in one field
after another, establish their equality
with men, without losing any of their
superiority in the exercise of those arts
to which they were formerly restricted.
And this chapter, therefore, after describing
the articles which relate to the present
political and economic position of women,
naturally turns to subjects such as
domestic science and the adornment of
the home, which in all ages and all countries
have been considered to be the
special province of women.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Women Contributors</div>

<p class='c007'>If the question of women’s ability to
do a full share of the world’s work any
longer admitted of argument, there would
be no more vivid
way of coming to an
appreciation of the
versatility and range
as well as the high quality of women’s
intellectual capacity than by looking at
the contributions by women to the
Britannica itself. First in mass, and
first in practical value as because it vastly
increases the usefulness of the entire
book, is the Index volume with its 975
pages, its 500,000 index entries, its
classified list of articles covering nearly
70 pages and its list of contributors and
their principal signed articles. This
volume was the work of a large and
carefully organized staff under the
supervision of Miss Janet Hogarth
(now Mrs. W. L. Courtney). The following

<p class='c007'>This remarkable list shows that women
have contributed to the Britannica on
subjects so varied as astronomy, medieval
literature, medicine, sociology, linguistics,
literary biography, art criticism,
law and politics, political science and
sociology, musical instruments, education,
the Bible and ecclesiastical history,
and philosophy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Woman’s Advance</div>

<p class='c007'>It may be noted as indicating the
advance of women during the last century
and a half that in the first edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica, which was
published in 1771, the article on women
consisted of the following eight words
“<span class='sc'>Woman</span>,—the female of man—see
<span class='sc'>Homo</span>.” In the present 11th edition,
published nearly a century and a half
later, one single article entitled <span class='sc'>Women</span>
in volume 28, beginning on page 782, is
equivalent in its contents to 22 pages
of this Guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>What woman has accomplished in
scholarship, literature, art and science
has been done very largely in the last
hundred years. In authorship and, to
a greater degree, on the stage her
activity dates back a little further. In
Shakespeare’s time all women’s parts on
the stage were taken by boys. In fact
as the Britannica tells us (Vol. 8, p. 521)
in the days of Queen Elizabeth and
Shakespeare “No woman might appear
at a playhouse, unless masked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is only in comparatively recent times
that the real “emancipation” of woman
began; and this explains why the list of
women famous in history is so much
longer than any of the other lists given
in this part of the Guide. Through
earlier periods women attained power
only by birth, by marriage, or by being
“queens uncrowned,” but none the less
powerful on that account, like Aspasia,
Nell Gwyn, Jane Shore and the Pompadour.</p>

<p class='c007'>There can be no question that during
most of the world’s history, woman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>only place was in the home. And it is
certain that no matter how far her emancipation
may be carried the home will
be <i>a</i> sphere for her. Her relation to
her husband and her children, her right
to a share of his property and of theirs—and
to her own—as now more liberally
granted and interpreted by law, are
outlined in the Britannica. The status
of women in early times is described in
the article in the Britannica on women.
It is, with variations in different places,
everywhere a story of dependence. Even
in Roman law a woman was completely
dependent. If married she and her
property passed into the power of her
husband; if unmarried she was (unless a
vestal virgin) under the perpetual tutelage
of her father during his life, and after
his death of her agnates, that is, of those
of kinsmen by blood or adoption who
would have been under the power of the
common ancestor had he lived. Under
English civil law a girl can contract a
valid marriage at 12, a boy at 14.
Under the common law “the father was
entitled as against the mother to the
custody of a legitimate child up to
the age of sixteen, and could only
forfeit such right by misconduct.” But
the Court of Chancery sometimes “took
a less rigid view of the paternal rights
and looked more to the interest of the
child, and consequently in some cases
to the extension of the mother’s right
at common law. Legislation has tended
in the same direction.” In England
women are still under two remarkable
disabilities: “the exclusion of female
heirs from intestate succession unless in
the absence of a male heir; and the fact
that a husband could obtain a divorce
for the adultery of his wife, while a wife
could only obtain it for her husband’s
adultery if coupled with some other
cause, such as cruelty or desertion.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Legal Status of American Women</div>

<p class='c007'>In the United States the legal and
political status of woman varies largely
with the laws of the different states.
For example, as is well known, in certain
states women have the same right as
men to the ballot.
Wyoming (1869) and
Colorado (1893) were
the first women’s
suffrage states. In
more than half the
states, roughly everywhere except in the
South and a few eastern states, she has
the right to vote for the members of
school boards and has a general school
suffrage. In Louisiana since 1898 women
tax-payers may vote on questions of
tax levies. As regards property rights,
in the state of New York, a woman in
possession of property, who marries, has
the unqualified use, irrespective of the
wishes of her husband, of her property.
That is, she owns and can spend as she
pleases the whole of the income of her
property, while, on the other hand, her
husband is compelled by law to give her
a certain proportion of his income. In
other states, Mississippi, notably, the
laws as regard property of married women
are precisely the same as that for married
men. If the husband is compelled
to give a certain proportion of his income
to his wife, she is compelled to
give the same proportion of her income
to him. This is true in several states,
Michigan, for example, except that married
women cannot usually convey property
without the husband’s permission.
In the state of New York a married
woman making her will has a right to
dispose of her property as she pleases;
whereas in other states, Missouri for
instance, the law prescribes that at least
one-half shall go to her husband, if there
are no children. In other words, in no
two states of the Union is the legal and
political status of woman the same.
It is often important, and in these days
always a matter of interest, for a woman
to know just what her legal position is
in the state in which she lives. This
information the Britannica gives.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a mother can do for her children
she may learn from the Britannica articles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>indicated in the chapters of this Guide
<i>For Children</i> and in the chapter <i>For
Teachers</i>. Similarly she will find assistance
in choosing, building or furnishing
a house from the chapters <i>For Builders
and Architects</i>, <i>For Designers</i>, <i>For Manufacturers
of Furniture</i>, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such articles as <span class='sc'>Lace</span>, <span class='sc'>Embroidery</span>,
<span class='sc'>Carpets</span>, <span class='sc'>Tapestry</span>, <span class='sc'>Furniture</span>, <span class='sc'>Painting</span>,
<span class='sc'>Sculpture</span>, <span class='sc'>Jewelry</span>, <span class='sc'>Plate</span>, particularly
as they are all remarkably well
illustrated, will be of great value either
for the general formation of taste or for
giving definite information about a particular
style. For the adornment of
“the House Beautiful” the Britannica
is, however, valuable not merely because
of the information it contains. The set
on India paper, compact, slender and
graceful, handsomely bound in leather,
and contained in one of the “period”
bookcases designed especially for the
books, is in itself an adornment and an ornament
for any library or drawing room.
For the country home with flower or vegetable
gardens the article <span class='sc'>Horticulture</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 741) will be found full of
helpful information, both in its general
treatment, and in the gardeners’ calendar
for the United States, which tells in the
most practical fashion what to do each
month in the garden.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Home Making</div>

<p class='c007'>For the transformation of a house,
well-situated, well-built, well-furnished,
well-decorated into a home,—for <i>home-making</i>,—any
course
of study in the Britannica
should be
helpful to a woman, by broadening her
sympathies and her knowledge and by
making a more interesting and better-informed
companion to her husband,
a more competent hostess to his and her
guests, and a wiser mother to her children.
But home-making is an art and not a
science—or, if the modern woman will
forgive the use of so old-fashioned a
phrase, it is a spiritual grace rather than
an intellectual achievement—and even
a Guide to readings in the Britannica
cannot give an exact formula for it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Domestic Science</div>

<p class='c007'>But there is a science whose field is
the home and whose formulas are definite,
and this “domestic science” may be
learned from the
Britannica. Of primary
interest is the
article <span class='sc'>Dietetics</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 214), equivalent in length to
25 pages of this Guide. It is by the
late Dr. Wilbur Olin Atwater, professor
of chemistry, Wesleyan University, Middletown,
Connecticut, who was special
agent of the U. S. Department of Agriculture
in charge of nutrition investigations,
and R. D. Milner, formerly of the
same Department. It contains 6 valuable
tables: I. Percentage Composition
of some Common Food Materials
(64 in all); II. Digestibility (or Availability)
of Nutrients in Different Classes
of Food Materials (22 in all); III. Estimates
of Heats of Combustion and of
Fuel Value of Nutrients in Ordinary
Mixed Diet; IV. Quantities of Available
Nutrients and Energy in Daily Food
Consumption of Persons in Different
Circumstances; V. Standards for Dietaries—Available
Nutrients and Energy
per Man per Day; and VI. Amounts of
Nutrients and Energy Furnished for one
Shilling in Food Materials at Ordinary
Prices (22 food materials, at 44 different
prices). The topics of the article are:</p>

<p class='c020'>Food and its functions—refuse,
water, mineral matter, protein, including
albuminoids and gelatinoids, fats,
carbohydrates.</p>

<p class='c020'>Conversion of food into body-material
and of food and body-material into
heat, muscular energy, etc., with results
obtained from Dr. Atwater’s
famous experiments with men in the
“respiration calorimeter,” from measurement
and analysis of food and
drink, and from measurement of energy
expended as heat and as external muscular
work.</p>

<p class='c020'>Composition of food materials.</p>

<p class='c020'>Digestibility or availability of foods.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Full value of food.</p>

<p class='c020'>Food consumption.</p>

<p class='c007'>Read also the article <span class='sc'>Nutrition</span> (Vol.
19, p. 920, equivalent to 25 pages of this
Guide), by Dr. D. N. Paton, professor
of physiology, University of Glasgow, and
Dr. E. P. Cathcart, lecturer in chemical
physiology, University of Glasgow.
This article considers “the mode of digestion,
the utilization and the elimination
of the end products of the three
great constituents, proteins, carbohydrates
and fats,” discussing in detail:</p>

<p class='c020'>Chemistry of Digestion—digestion in
the mouth, stomach and the intestines;
bile.</p>

<p class='c020'>Mode of Formation of Digestive
Secretions—the salivary and gastric
glands, secretion in the pancreas, intestinal
juice.</p>

<p class='c020'>Mechanism of the Alimentary Canal—mastication,
swallowing, stomach
movements, intestinal movements, etc.</p>

<p class='c020'>Absorption by the mouth, stomach
and intestines.</p>

<p class='c020'>Changes in the cells—proteins, carbohydrates,
fats, fasting, muscular
work, internal secretions, pancreas.</p>

<p class='c020'>Excretion—urea, ammonia, sulphur,
phosphorus, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cookery</div>

<p class='c007'>There is much very practical information
for the housewife in the article
<span class='sc'>Cookery</span> (Vol. 7, p. 74), besides the interesting
historical sketch. Cookery,
says this article, as
an art “is only remotely connected with
the mere necessities of nutrition or the
science of dietetics. Mere hunger, though
the best sauce, will not produce cookery,
which is the art of sauces.” Oriental, Greek
and Roman cookery, at least as we know
them from literature, aimed at luxury,
rich and rare foods, cost and show.
After the Renaissance, the history of
modern cookery began with Italy, and
from Italy Catherine de’ Medici brought
“Italian cooks to Paris and introduced
there a cultured simplicity which was
unknown in France before.” <i>Forks and
spoons were “Italian neatnesses” unknown
in England until the early part of the 17th
century</i>; their use “marked an epoch in
the progress of dining, and consequently
of cookery.” French cookery advanced
under Louis XIV and XV; received an
apparent set back from the French
Revolution—which, however, marked
the rise of Parisian restaurants; but
revived with brilliancy early in the 19th
century, so that now “French cooking
is admittedly the ideal of culinary art,
directly we leave the plain roast and
boiled. And the spread of cosmopolitan
hotels and restaurants over England,
America and the European continent,
has largely accustomed the whole civilized
world to the Parisian type.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The article closes with eminently useful
“notes on broiling, roasting, baking,
boiling, stewing and frying.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Food</span> (Vol. 10, p. 611) describes
particularly the best foods for
infants and children; foods for adults
are treated in <span class='sc'>Nutrition</span>, <span class='sc'>Dietetics</span>,
already mentioned, and in the article
<span class='sc'>Vegetarianism</span> (Vol. 27, p. 967). Other
articles of importance to the cook are:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Food Preservation</span> (Vol. 10, p. 612),
by Otto Hehner, English public analyst,
formerly president of the Society of
Public Analysts; and the same authority’s
article on <span class='sc'>Adulteration</span> (Vol. 1, p. 218),
which deals with legislation against adulteration,
and discusses arsenic in foods,
preservatives such as formaldehyde and
salicylic acid, boracic preservatives,—colouring
matter in food, metallic impurities;
American laws against adulteration;
German laws; particular articles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>adulterated—milk, condensed milk,
cream, butter, margarine, cheese, lard,
oils, flour and bread, sugar, marmalade,
jams, tea, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, wine,
beer, non-alcoholic drinks, vinegar, spirits,
drugs. See the chapter <i>For Manufacturers

<div class='sidenote'>Costume and Ornament</div>

<p class='c007'>Turning sharply from the useful to
the ornamental—from the kitchen to
the boudoir—the woman who uses the
Britannica will find
in it not merely the
interesting information
to which clues
are given in the chapter for the jeweller
and in the section on embroidery (Ch. 66)
but many other articles about costume
and dress, with illustrations which make
the text far clearer and more valuable.
With the constant turns of Fashion’s
wheel, dress, and especially women’s
dress, is always reverting to an earlier
style or to a more primitive and semi-barbaric
style of the present day—now
Empire styles, Robespierre collars, close-fitting
gowns of the pseudo-Greek style
of the Napoleonic era, and now a quasi-folk
style, Bulgarian, or Oriental, and
again a hint of the ecclesiastical surplice,
dalmatic, stole, or collar. The result is
that the study of the styles of the past,
especially when properly illustrated, may
be not only interesting but actually
valuable to a woman planning a new
gown or a “novel” ornament for head or
throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Costume</span> (Vol. 7, p. 224),
equivalent in length to 80 pages of this
Guide, is written by T. A. Joyce of the
Department of Ethnography, British Museum;
by Stanley Arthur Cook, editor
for the Palestine Exploration Fund,
on Egyptian and Semitic costume; by
Henry Stuart Jones, late director of the
British School at Rome, on Aegean,
Greek and Roman costume; by Oswald
Barron, late editor of the <i>Ancestor</i>,
on medieval and modern costume; and
by W. Alison Phillips, author of <i>Modern
Europe</i>, etc. Its 51 illustrations are
chosen with great care from original
sources, tombs, wall-paintings, seals,
statues and statuettes, brasses, and portraits
of many periods, and they are
supplemented by illustrations in other
articles:—<span class='sc'>Aegean Civilization</span> (Vol. 1,
p. 245), see Plate III, Fig. 7 and Plate
IV, Fig. 7, for multiple or flounced
skirts and basques—like those of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>early ’80’s—with short overskirt scalloped
high on either side; <span class='sc'>Greek Art</span>, Figs. 2,
3, 21, 40, 42, 75; <span class='sc'>Terracotta</span> (Vol. 26,
p. 653), see both plates and especially
Fig. 4 of Tanagra and other figurines;
<span class='sc'>Roman Art</span> (Vol. 23, p. 474), see Figs.
11, 12, 16, 24, 28; <span class='sc'>Brasses, Monumental</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 434), see all illustrations;
<span class='sc'>Illuminated Manuscripts</span> (Vol. 14, p.
312), see Plates III and V; <span class='sc'>Painting</span>
(Vol. 20, p. 459), see Figs. 7, 10, 11, 14,
25, 27; <span class='sc'>Lace</span> (Vol. 16, p. 37), see Figs.
4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 33; <span class='sc'>Miniatures</span>
(Vol. 18, p. 523), see both plates.
One of the most interesting sources for
the text of the article <span class='sc'>Costume</span> is in the
writings of satirists, who from period
to period have praised the simplicity and
frugality of the preceding generation and
bewailed the extravagance in style and
material of dress during the satirists’ own
day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides this general article on costume
there is special treatment of Chinese
costume in the article <span class='sc'>China</span> (Vol. 6,
p. 173) and a section on costume in the
article <span class='sc'>India</span> (Vol. 14, p. 417), equivalent
to 18 pages of this Guide, written by
Col. Charles Grant, formerly inspector
of military education in India, illustrated
with 16 pen-and-ink drawings by J.
Lockwood Kipling, who is best-known to
most people as the father of Rudyard
Kipling, and the illustrator of <i>Kim</i>, his
son’s story of native life in India. On
Celtic dress see the article <span class='sc'>Clan</span> (Vol. 6,
p. 421); on that of the Hittites the article
<span class='sc'>Hittites</span> (Vol. 13, p. 537); on modern
Egyptian the article <span class='sc'>Egypt</span> (Vol. 9, p. 31),
on Persian, the article <span class='sc'>Persia</span> (Vol. 21, p.
193), etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both in Great Britain and in the United States the great social reform movements
of the last century numbered among their most able advocates brilliant and devoted
women. This is true of temperance, abolition of slavery, prison reform, the treatment
of the insane and defectives, and nearly every branch which this Guide has
enumerated, especially in Part 4, where there is a general outline of these reforms.
For the part played by women see the biographies of the women just mentioned and,
among many others, <span class='sc'>Jane Addams</span>, <span class='sc'>Clara Barton</span>, <span class='sc'>Baroness Burdett-Coutts</span>,
<span class='sc'>Dorothea Lynde Dix</span>, <span class='sc'>Emily Faithful</span>, <span class='sc'>Elizabeth Fry</span>, <span class='sc'>Octavia</span> and <span class='sc'>Miranda
Hill</span>, <span class='sc'>Mary A. Livermore</span> and <span class='sc'>Lucretia Mott</span>. More particularly the following
list of names of women connected with educational progress will supplement what
has been said in the chapter of this Guide <i>For Teachers</i> and in the part of the Guide
dealing with advances in education and educational problems in the chapter
<i>Questions of the Day</i>:</p>

<p class='c007'>And see also the articles <span class='sc'>Co-education</span> and articles on different colleges for
women, e.g., <span class='sc'>Mount Holyoke</span>, <span class='sc'>Vassar</span>, <span class='sc'>Bryn Mawr</span>, <span class='sc'>Smith</span>, etc. One who wishes to
realize the extent of feminine talent or genius should read the lives in the Britannica
of the sculptor <span class='sc'>Harriet Hosmer</span> and of women painters including <span class='sc'>Cecilia Beaux</span>,
<span class='sc'>Rosa Bonheur</span>, <span class='sc'>Artemisia Gentileschi</span>, <span class='sc'>Kate Greenway</span>, <span class='sc'>Angelica Kauffmann</span>,
<span class='sc'>Teresa Schwartze</span> and <span class='sc'>Mme. Vigée-Lebrun</span>. But the reader who is eager
rather to know whether woman’s intellectual powers—not her talent and her genius—compare
favourably with those of the male, will find material in the biographical
sketches of the physicist <span class='sc'>Mme. Curie</span>; the geologist <span class='sc'>Mary Anning</span>; the travelers
<span class='sc'>Isabella Bird Bishop</span> and <span class='sc'>Alexandrina Tinné</span>; the biologists <span class='sc'>Marianne North</span>
and <span class='sc'>Eleanor Ormerod</span>; the American ethnologist <span class='sc'>Alice C. Fletcher</span>; and above
all—since mathematics has always been considered above the capacity of women—the
mathematicians <span class='sc'>Maria Gaetana Agnesi</span> and <span class='sc'>Sophie Kovalevsky</span> and the
astronomers <span class='sc'>Agnes Mary Clerke</span>, <span class='sc'>Maria Cunitz</span>, <span class='sc'>Caroline Herschel</span>, <span class='sc'>Maria
Mitchell</span> and <span class='sc'>Mary Somerville</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is pertinent to add that the present 11th edition of the Britannica indicates
the advance of women not only by embodying their collaboration to an unprecedented
extent and devoting an unprecedented amount of its space to biographies of women,
but by the circumstance that it has, to a far larger extent than any previous edition,
been purchased by women.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXVI<br> <span class='c014'>RECREATION AND VACATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>“Laying out your work” is a
familiar phrase, and describes a
common practice. But hardly
one man in a hundred deliberately “lays
out” his play, planning his recreation so
as to get the best value out of every hour
of his leisure time. Yet when he consults
a doctor because his work is not running
smoothly, one of the first questions he
has to answer is about the amount and
form of recreation he takes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Recreative Reading about Recreation</div>

<p class='c007'>An important branch of the art of
playing is to learn the value of reading
about play. The more a man knows
about any form of
amusement, the
more he will enjoy
the hours he devotes
to it, and the
better he will succeed in keeping his
mind off his business during these hours.
But there is another and an even greater
advantage in this kind of reading: <i>it will
take your mind out-of-doors during hours
of leisure that you are compelled to spend
in-doors</i>. Everyone recognizes that out-door
recreations, involving some degree
of bodily activity, are the most wholesome
for men whose work is sedentary,
as is the case with nearly every reader
of this Guide, and the best forms of out-door
recreation are those in which the
contrast with your work is accentuated
by the complete change of scene and
of habits which most men can only
hope to get once a year, at vacation
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turn to the next best form of relaxation,
the out-door amusements that lie
close at hand. Here, again, your opportunities
are limited, for all these pleasures
require daylight, which, during a great
part of the year, ends before your work is
done; and most of them require weather
conditions that you can only get at certain
seasons. An hour spent in reading
and thinking about out-door amusements
and travel, and in making plans
for such delights, even if the planning
must be for a future that seems far away,
is therefore always refreshing.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not the purpose of the present
chapter to suggest a course of reading,
in the strict sense of the phrase, for it
cannot be assumed that everyone who
would like to read about lawn-tennis
would also like to read about tarpon-fishing.
But a general account of the
Britannica articles that afford information
about recreation and vacations will
give the reader a choice among subjects
in which he is already interested and
among others which may offer him new
possibilities.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MOTORING</h4>

<p class='c017'>In connection with motoring, the possessor
of the Britannica will not be surprised
to find in it, as might be expected
from its universal comprehensiveness,
much fuller technical information in regard
to the structure and operation of
his engine, the fuel he employs, and the
friction and other resistances he must
overcome, than in any of the ordinary
manuals on the subject. But it may not
occur to him that in planning either a
long or a short tour, he can find in the
volumes information of other kinds that
will give added interest and significance
to everything he sees. It is not only
when he crosses the Atlantic for his
motoring trip that cities and villages and
mountains and rivers have stories to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>tell. In our own country, place-names
which may at first suggest nothing, are
found, on reference to the Britannica, to
be associated with episodes of early exploration,
of Indian hostilities, of local
agitation, of one or another war, with the
lives of famous men, the growth of industries
and of commerce, the first success
in a new branch of farming, the
early days of railroad and canal construction,
or the development of transportation
by river, lake or sea. And
what is being done to-day, in these
places, is often quite as interesting, and
quite as difficult to ascertain from any
source other than the Britannica. This
use of the work as a guide-book, or rather
as doing a great deal that guide-books
lamentably fail to do, is discussed later
in this chapter in connection with travel
in general as a form of recreation;
but motoring gives especial opportunities
for observation enriched by knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The value of the Britannica in connection
with the planning of a motoring
trip may be illustrated by brief notes on
some of the articles you might read if
you were about to make, for example,
the run from New York through the
Berkshire Hills and on to the White
Mountains. <i>The following information
is all from the Britannica, and from articles
to which you would naturally turn
in this connection.</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A Specimen Tour from New York to the White Mountains</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Along the Hudson</div>

<p class='c020'>Leaving New York by Broadway,
your first point is <span class='sc'>Yonkers</span> (Vol. 28, p.
922), where, as the Britannica tells
you, stands “one of the best examples
of colonial architecture in America,”
Philipse Manor Hall, now a museum of
Revolutionary relics. Frederick Philipse,
owner in 1779 of the Hall and of
an estate extending for some distance
along the bank of the Hudson, was suspected
of Toryism, and all his property
was confiscated by act of legislature.
A mile and a half beyond Yonkers you
get a magnificent view of the Hudson,
disclosing the Palisades, of lava rock
(Vol. 13, p. 852) which, in cooling,
formed joints like those of the Giant’s
Causeway in Ireland. The impressive
breadth of the Hudson and its navigability
throughout the 151 miles to
Troy, notwithstanding
that in all that
distance it falls only
five feet (a good
many New Yorkers would be amazed
to be told that fact), is due to the low
grade of the river bed, permitting the
tide to enter and to back up the water,
so that this long stretch of the river is
really a fjord, not a stream. The article
Fjord (Vol. 10, p. 452) tells you
how such a rock basin or trough is
formed by geological action. The article
<span class='sc'>Henry Hudson</span> (Vol. 13, p.
849) tells you how the great navigator,
himself an Englishman, although employed
by the Dutch East India Company
in 1608 to find a westward route
to China, sailed the little “Half
Moon” as far up the river as Albany
before he was convinced that the
Pacific did not lie ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c020'>The next point after Yonkers, <span class='sc'>Dobbs
Ferry</span> (Vol. 8, p. 349), was a strategic
centre of great importance during the
Revolutionary War. “The American
Army under Washington encamped
near Dobbs Ferry on the 4th of July,
1781, and started thence for Yorktown
in the following month,” and it was
there that Washington and Governor
Clinton, in 1783, “met General Sir
Guy Carleton to negotiate for the evacuation
by the British troops of the
posts they still held in the United
States.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sleepy Hollow</div>

<p class='c020'>In <span class='sc'>Tarrytown</span>, as the article under
that title (Vol. 26, p. 433) recounts,
Washington Irving, who made the legends
of the Hudson immortal, built
his home at “Sunnyside,”
and was
buried in the old
Sleepy Hollow
Cemetery. The article <span class='sc'>Irving</span> (Vol. 14,
p. 856), by the late Dr. Richard Garnett,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>the famous literary critic, tells you
all about Irving’s life; and Professor
Woodberry of Columbia, in his article
on <span class='sc'>American Literature</span> (Vol. 1, p.
831), reminds you that, although Irving
spent 21 of his adult years in
Europe, he is the one American writer
who has “linked his memory locally
with his country so that it hangs over
the landscape and blends with it forever.”
“Kaakoot,” one of the large
estates at Tarrytown, recalls the extraordinary
career of its owner, described
in the article <span class='sc'>John D. Rockefeller</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 433); and “Lyndhurst,”
that of Jay Gould, of whom
and of whose daughter, the well-known
philanthropist, the Britannica tells in
the article <span class='sc'>Gould</span> (Vol. 12, p. 284).
On the post road near Tarrytown is the
bronze statue of a Continental soldier,
erected to commemorate the capture of
Major André, whose life is told in the
article <span class='sc'>André</span> (Vol. 1, p. 968).</p>

<p class='c020'>As you mount the hill and leave the
Hudson, you enter the beautiful region
of hills, lake and streams, upon
which the city of New York long
depended for its water; and you
will be interested in comparing what
New York has accomplished in this
connection with what has been done by
other great cities, as described in the
article <span class='sc'>Water Supply</span> (Vol. 28, p.
387), by G. F. Deacon. Many of the
large country places you pass are the
property of prominent New York men,
of whom there are biographies in the
Britannica.</p>

<p class='c020'>Your brief run through the hilly
northwestern corner of Connecticut, of
which the physical features are described
and the history narrated in the
article <span class='sc'>Connecticut</span> (Vol. 6, p. 951),
takes you through <span class='sc'>Salisbury</span> (Vol. 24,
p. 78), near Bear Mountain (2355
feet), “the highest point in the State.”
A few miles more and you cross the
line into Massachusetts and enter the
enchanting region of the Berkshire
Hills. The article <span class='sc'>Massachusetts</span>
(Vol. 17, p. 851) says that “the Berkshire
country—Berkshire, Hampden,
Hampshire and Franklin counties—is
among the most beautiful regions of the
United States. It is a rolling highland,
dominated by long, wooded hill-ridges,
remarkably even-topped in general
elevation, intersected and broken
by deep valleys. Scores of charming
lakes lie in the hollows.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great Barrington</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Great Barrington</span> (Vol. 12, p.
397) “was a centre of disaffection
during Shays’s Rebellion,” an episode
for which you may
consult the article
<span class='sc'>Daniel Shays</span>
(Vol. 24, p. 815),
and the account in the historical section
of the article <span class='sc'>Massachusetts</span> (Vol. 17,
p. 860). In 1786 Shays was known as
having been “a brave Revolutionary
captain of no special personal importance.”
The State finances were in a
bad condition and taxes were heavy.
Mobs of discontented citizens, under
Shays’s leadership, assembled to prevent
the courts from sitting, so that the
collection of taxes and other debts
might be obstructed. “The insurrection
is regarded as having been very
potent in preparing public opinion
throughout the country for the adoption
of a stronger national government.”
<span class='sc'>William Cullen Bryant</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 698), “earliest of the master-poets
of America,” practiced law at
Great Barrington for nine years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stockbridge</div>

<p class='c020'>Leaving Great Barrington, you cross
Monument Mountain (1710 feet) on
your way to <span class='sc'>Stockbridge</span> (Vol. 25, p.
929) with its famous
avenue of
elms—perhaps the
most characteristic New England scene
in all the Berkshire country. The conspicuous
bell-tower was erected by
<span class='sc'>David Dudley Field</span> (Vol. 10, p.
321), the law reformer, whose proposed
code of laws for the State of New
York was the model on which most
of the existing state codes have been
based. The park was the gift of his
brother, <span class='sc'>Cyrus W. Field</span> (Vol. 10, p.
320), born at Stockbridge, to whom we
owe the first Atlantic cable. In 1834,
at the age of 15, he became a clerk in
the great New York store described in
the article <span class='sc'>A. T. Stewart</span> (Vol. 25, p.
912); later embarked in the wholesale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>paper business in New York, failed,
formed the firm of Cyrus W. Field &#38;
Co., and in 1853, at the age of 34, had
made a quarter of a million, a large
fortune in those days, paid off the debts
of the paper business, and nominally
retired. From that time he was chiefly
occupied with the cable scheme, of
which the early difficulties are described
in the cable section of the article
<span class='sc'>Telegraph</span> (Vol. 26, p. 527), although
he operated actively in stocks, was associated
with <span class='sc'>Jay Gould</span> (Vol. 12, p.
284) in completing the Wabash Railroad,
and had a controlling interest in
the New York Elevated Railroad, besides
being chief proprietor of the New
York <i>Mail and Express</i>.</p>

<p class='c020'>When, in 1750, <span class='sc'>Jonathan Edwards</span>
(Vol. 9, p. 3), the famous New England
theologian, had to leave his church
at Northampton, he became pastor
at Stockbridge and missionary to
the Housatonic Indians, remaining
there until 1759. It was there that he
wrote his famous treatise on the <i>Freedom
of the Will</i>. In a cleft on Bear
Mountain, just outside the village, is
the curious Ice Glen, with caverns ice-lined
even in midsummer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lenox</div>

<p class='c020'>On the road from Stockbridge to
Lenox you pass the beautiful lake
called the Stockbridge Bowl, on the
shore of which <span class='sc'>Nathaniel Hawthorne</span>,
in 1851, wrote <i>The House of
the Seven Gables</i>. His reason for
adopting literature as a vocation is
quaintly stated in a letter to his mother
quoted in this Britannica biography.
“I do not want to be a doctor and live
by men’s diseases, nor a minister to live
by their sins, nor a lawyer and live by
their quarrels. So I don’t see that
there is anything left for me but to
be an author.” <span class='sc'>Lenox</span> (Vol. 16, p.
421) is surrounded by high hills, famous
for their vivid coloring when the
leaves change their hues
in the fall, Yokun Seat
(2080 feet), South
Mountain (1200 feet), Bald Head
(1583 feet) and Rattlesnake Hill
(1540 feet). “The surrounding region
contains some of the most beautiful
country of the Berkshires—hills, lakes,
charming intervales and woods. As
early as 1835 Lenox began to attract
summer residents. In the next decade
began the creation of large estates, although
the great holdings of the present
day, and the villas scattered over
the hills, are comparatively recent features.”
The township was named after
the third Duke of <span class='sc'>Richmond and
Lennox</span> (Vol. 23, p. 307), “a firm
supporter of the colonies in the debates
on the policy that led to the War of
American Independence; and he initiated
the debate of 1778 calling for the
removal of the troops from America.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Among other names associated with
Lenox and with its famous schools are
those of the actress <span class='sc'>Frances Kemble</span>—“Fanny”
Kemble (Vol. 15, p. 724);
<span class='sc'>Henry Ward Beecher</span> (Vol. 3, p.
639); <span class='sc'>Harriet Hosmer</span> (Vol. 13, p.
791), the sculptor; <span class='sc'>Mark Hopkins</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 684), the famous president
of Williams College; <span class='sc'>Alexander H.
Stephens</span> (Vol. 25, p. 887), vice-president
of the Confederate States, who,
the article <span class='sc'>Confederate States of
America</span> (Vol. 6, p. 899), says, was
“during the war a strong antagonist of
President Davis’s policy;” and <span class='sc'>William
H. Yancey</span> (Vol. 28, p. 902),
whose fortunes were influenced by a
singular event. A lawyer, and editor
of a little anti-nullification weekly in
South Carolina, he married a wealthy
woman; but a few years later, in 1839,
the accidental poisoning of all the
slaves on the estate forced him to return
to the law; and he subsequently
became one of the political leaders of
the Confederacy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pittsfield</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Pittsfield</span> (Vol. 21, p. 682) is both
a popular resort and a prosperous manufacturing
town, with ample water
power supplied by
the east and west
branches of the
Housatonic on either side of it. It
was here that <span class='sc'>Henry W. Longfellow</span>
(Vol. 16, p. 977) wrote <i>The Old Clock
on the Stairs</i> at “Elm Knoll,” the
house of his father-in-law, <span class='sc'>Nathan
Appleton</span> (Vol. 2, p. 224), a reference
to whose biography in the Britannica
discloses the interesting fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>his son, Thomas Gold Appleton, a famous
wit in his day, originated the
saying, “Good Americans when they
die, go to Paris,” which is generally
attributed to Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Just outside Pittsfield lies the village
of the <span class='sc'>Shakers</span> (Vol. 24, p. 771), the
curious sect founded by Ann Lee,
daughter of a blacksmith in Manchester,
England, who came to America
with a small party of her adherents in
1714. The road through <span class='sc'>Adams</span> (Vol.
1, p. 181), affords a view of Greylock
Mountain (3535 feet), the highest
point in Massachusetts; and at <span class='sc'>North
Adams</span> (Vol. 19, p. 760), there is a
natural bridge 50–60 feet high across
Hudson Brook; and you can see the
ruins of Fort Massachusetts, captured
in 1746 by the French with the aid of
the Indians. Here is also the western
end of the Hoosac Tunnel, 5¾ miles
long. The article <span class='sc'>Tunnels</span> (Vol. 27,
p. 405) says that the piercing of this
tunnel, begun in 1835 and not finished
until 1876, was marked by the first
American use of air drills and nitroglycerin;
and the article <span class='sc'>Power
Transmission</span> (Vol. 22, p. 232) describes
the influence which this successful
employment of compressed air had
in furthering its use for the noisy
“gun” tools now so familiar.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Williamstown</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Williamstown</span> (Vol. 28, p. 685),
the last town in Massachusetts on your
route, is the seat of Williams College;
and the “Haystack
Monument”
in Mission Park,
stands where the prayer meeting was
held which was the forerunner of
the American foreign missionary
movement described in the article
<span class='sc'>Missions</span> (Vol. 18, p. 583), which
contains the interesting statement that
in the 3rd century the proportion of
Christians to the whole human race
was one to 150, while it is now one to
three. The article <span class='sc'>Vermont</span> (Vol.
27, p. 1025) contains an interesting
summary of the early disputes over
state boundaries in this part of New
England.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bennington</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Bennington</span> (Vol. 3, p. 743) lies
at the foot of the Green Mountains,
near Mt. Anthony (2345 feet). “The
Bennington Battle
Monument, a
shaft 301 feet
high, is said to be the highest battle
monument in the world. It commemorates
the success gained on the 16th of
August, 1777, by a force of nearly
2000 ‘Green Mountain Boys’ and
New Hampshire and Massachusetts
militia&#160;... over two detachments
of General Burgoyne’s army,” of whom
700 were taken prisoners. The article
<span class='sc'>American War of Independence</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 842) shows how important
an effect this victory had on Burgoyne’s
campaign. In 1825 <span class='sc'>William Lloyd
Garrison</span> (Vol. 11, p. 477), the anti-slavery
leader, edited a paper at Bennington,
leaving it when <span class='sc'>Benjamin
Lundy</span> (Vol. 17, p. 124), the Quaker
abolitionist, determined to secure Garrison’s
co-operation on a Baltimore
abolitionist magazine, “walked through
the ice and snow of a New England
winter from Boston to Bennington, 125
miles,” and persuaded Garrison to join
him. Bennington was the home of
<span class='sc'>Ethan Allen</span> (Vol. 1, p. 691), the
frontier hero who led the “Green
Mountain Boys” and of <span class='sc'>Seth Warner</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 327), who subsequently
became their colonel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hanover</div>

<p class='c020'>On leaving Bennington you can
choose any one of several routes to
bring you over to the Connecticut
River, but, whichever you take, you
will be fairly on the main route to the
White Mountains (by which you would
have gone from New York through
Waterbury, Springfield and Greenfield
if you had not included the Berkshires
in your itinerary) when
you reach <span class='sc'>Hanover, N.
H.</span> (Vol. 12, p. 927).
Here, “ranges of rugged hills, broken
by deep, narrow gorges and by the
wider valley of Mink Brook, rise near
the river and culminate in Moose
Mountain, 2326 feet above the sea.”
Near the foot of that peak is the birthplace
of <span class='sc'>Laura D. Bridgman</span> (Vol. 4,
p. 559), the first blind deaf-mute to be
successfully educated. Dr. <span class='sc'>S. G. Howe</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 837), who was head of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>Perkins Institute for the Blind in Boston,
heard of her case in 1837, took
charge of her in October of that year,
and by June, 1840, at eleven years of
age, her mind had become as well developed
as that of a normal child of
her age. Charles Dickens saw her
when he was in America in 1842, and
his account of her case led to the introduction
in England, and afterwards
in all parts of Europe, of the Howe
system of training.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dartmouth College</div>

<p class='c020'>The attractions which Hanover owes
to its picturesque site are enhanced by
the fine buildings and the notably beautiful
campus of <span class='sc'>Dartmouth College</span>
(Vol. 7, p. 838). The purpose for
which this college was originally
founded is quaintly expressed in its
charter, granted by George III in
1769. See the article on <span class='sc'>Indians,
North American</span> (Vol. 14, p. 452).
This document ordains “that there
be a college erected in our Province
of New Hampshire by the name
of Dartmouth
College, for the
education and instruction
of youth
of the Indian Tribes in this Land in
reading, writing and all parts of
Learning which shall appear necessary
and expedient for civilizing and christianizing
children of pagans&#160;...
and also of English youth and any
other.”</p>

<p class='c020'>With the name of Dartmouth College
will always be associated that of
<span class='sc'>Daniel Webster</span> (Vol. 28, p. 460),
not only because he was graduated
there in 1801, but because the famous
“Dartmouth College case,” in which
Webster appeared for the college before
the United States Supreme Court,
was the first in which that august tribunal
fully asserted its power to support
the Federal constitution by nullifying
any usurpatory statutes passed
by state legislatures.</p>

<p class='c020'>When you turn away from the Connecticut
River to go up the valley of
the Ammonoosuc, you are fairly in the
White Mountain region, which the Britannica
(Vol. 19, p. 490) describes in
part as follows:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The White Mountains</div>

<p class='c032'>“The White Mountains, a continuation
of the Appalachian system, rise very
abruptly in several short ranges and in
outlying mountain
masses from a base
level of 700–1500 ft. to
generally rounded summits,
the heights of several
of which are nowhere exceeded in the
eastern part of the United States except
in the Black and the Unaka mountains of
North Carolina; seventy-four rise more
than 3000 ft. above the sea, twelve more
than 5000 ft., and the highest, Mount
Washington, attains an elevation of 6293 ft.</p>

<p class='c032'>The principal ranges, the Presidential,
the Franconia and the Carter-Moriah, have
a north-eastern and south-western trend.
The Presidential, in the north-eastern part
of the region, is separated from the Franconia
on the south-west by the Crawford,
or White Mountain Notch, about 2000 ft.
in depth, in which the Ammonoosuc and
Saco rivers find a passage, and from the
Carter-Moriah, parallel to it on the east,
by the Glen-Ellis and Peabody rivers, the
former noted for its beautiful falls. On
the Presidential range, which is about 20
m. in length, are Mount Washington and
nine other peaks exceeding 5000 ft. in
height: Mount Adams, 5805 ft.; Mount Jefferson,
5725 ft.; Mount Sam Adams, 5585
ft.; Mount Clay, 5554 ft.; Boot Spur, 5520
ft.; Mount Monroe, 5390 ft.; J. Q. Adams
Peak, 5384 ft.; Mount Madison, 5380 ft.;
and Mount Franklin, 5028 ft. On the
Franconia, a much shorter range, are
Mount Lafayette, 5269 ft.; Mount Lincoln,
5098 ft.; and four others exceeding 4000 ft.
The highest peak on the Carter-Moriah
range is Carter Dome, 4860 ft., but seven
others exceed 4000 ft. Loftiest of the isolated
mountains is Moosilauke noted for
its magnificent view-point, 4810 ft. above
the sea. Separating Franconia and Pemigewasset
ranges is the romantic Franconia
Notch, overlooking which from the upper
cliffs of Profile Mountain is a remarkable
human profile, <i>The Great Stone Face</i>, immortalized
by Nathaniel Hawthorne; here,
too, is the Franconia Flume, a narrow upright
fissure, 60 ft. in height, with beautiful
waterfalls.</p>

<p class='c032'>The whole White Mountain region
abounds in deep narrow valleys, romantic
glens, ravines, flumes, waterfalls, brooks
and lakes.... The headwaters of the
rivers are for the most part mountain
streams or elevated lakes; farther on their
swift and winding currents—flowing sometimes
between wide intervales, sometimes
between rocky banks—are marked by numerous
falls and fed by lakes.</p>

<p class='c032'>The lakes and ponds, numbering several
hundred, were formed by glacial action
and the scenery of many of them is scarcely
less attractive than that of the mountains.
The largest and most widely known is Lake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>Winnepesaukee on the S. border of the
White Mountain region; this is about 20
m. long and from 1 to 8 m. wide, is dotted
by 274 islands, mostly verdant, and has
clear water and a rather level shore, back
of which hills or mountains rise on all sides.
Among the more prominent of many others
that are admired for their beauty are
Squam, New Found, Sunapee and Ossipee,
all within a radius of a few miles from
Winnepesaukee; Massabesic farther S.;
and Diamond Ponds, Umbagog and Connecticut
lakes, N. of the White Mountains.
The rivers with their numerous falls and
the lakes with their high altitudes furnish
a vast amount of water power for manufacturing,
the Merrimac, in particular, into
which many of the larger lakes, including
Winnepesaukee, find an outlet, is one of
the greatest power-yielding streams of the
world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After exploring the country thus described
in the Britannica, you can take
for your return trip to New York, the
route by Portland, Me., that by Lake
Winnepesaukee and Portsmouth, or, that
by Plymouth and Manchester, N. H.
By any of these ways, you will visit Boston,
and its famous suburbs, Concord,
Lexington, Brookline, Salem and Marblehead,
whose historical and literary
associations are fully described in the
Britannica.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Automobiles</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Motor Vehicles</span> (Vol. 18,
p. 914), with 37 illustrations, is by the
late C. S. Rolls, the famous builder and
driver of motor cars,
with a special section
on commercial
vehicles, by Edward Shrapnell Smith,
editor of <i>The Commercial Motor</i>. The
story of the development of the car, told
at the beginning of the article, is full of
human interest, for it shows how national
characteristics affect industries.
From 1802, when Richard Trevithick
built, in England, the first practical road
carriage, until 1885, all the most promising
efforts to further mechanical road
traffic were made by English inventors.
As early as 1824 there was a regular
motor-omnibus service between Cheltenham
and Gloucester, at a speed that
sometimes (perhaps down a hill) reached
14 miles an hour; and if inventors had
been encouraged, the effort to lighten
road engines would have produced the
tubular boiler long before it actually appeared.
But the influence of the landowning,
horse-breeding, horse-loving English
aristocracy was too strong, and one
act of Parliament after another imposed
destructive restrictions, culminating in
the law passed in 1865, making 4 miles
an hour the maximum speed, and requiring
that a man showing a red flag
should march ahead of the engine! Of
course this drove every engine off the
road except a steam roller or the heaviest
type of traction engine. In 1885 Daimler
invented the internal combustion engine,
and for a moment Germany seemed likely
to lead the world. But Daimler failed to
hit upon a satisfactory system of transmission,
and although his engine worked
well in motor boats, the risk of starting a
car on the road was too great. His boat,
shown at the Paris Exposition of 1887,
attracted the attention of the French
firm of Panhard &#38; Levassor, makers of
wood-working machinery. They bought
the French rights, and Levassor devised
the clutch, the gear-box and the whole
system of connecting the engine with its
work, which, save for improvements in
detail, are all in use to-day. In 1895 the
French car which won the race from Paris
to Bordeaux covered the 744 miles at a
mean speed of 15 miles an hour, and the
world realized that the motor car was a
practical means of transportation. But
it was not until 1896 that the English
parliament gave cars the freedom of the
roads, and that English manufacturers
could see a future for themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the United States, the industry began
under great difficulties. The roads,
except in the immediate outskirts of the
larger cities, were abominable, and no
system of suspension that could make
them tolerable had yet been discovered.
But though starting late, by 1906 the
United States overtook and passed
France, becoming the foremost car building
and car using nation of the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>Nowhere else are factories worked upon
so large a scale, and nowhere else are
really serviceable cars so light and so
cheap. And the greatest recent improvement
in the gasolene engine, the Knight
sleeve-valve, is an American invention.
It is, altogether, a curious story, this
struggle in which England, Germany
and France, one after another, seemed
destined to attain the leadership
which in the end fell to the United
States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning to the subsidiary articles
which relate to motoring, the gasolene
engine is elaborately discussed in <span class='sc'>Oil
Engine</span> (Vol. 20, p. 35), by Dugald Clerk,
an expert engineer and himself the inventor
of the Clerk cycle engine. This
article shows how complete a change
in engineering practice was effected in
1883, when it was demonstrated that
small engines could be run at a thousand
revolutions a minute, a speed four times
as great as any previously contemplated.
All the types of carburetter are described,
with mechanical diagrams. Other diagrams
show the action of the inner and
outer sleeves of the Knight valves.
Gasolene, and the experiments made in
search of a less costly fuel, are dealt with
in the article <span class='sc'>Fuel</span> (Vol. 11, p. 274), by
Prof. Georg Lunge, of the Zurich Polytechnic,
the greatest of all authorities on
the subject. Tires, the bugbear of every
car-owner, form the subject of a separate
article Tire (Vol. 26, p. 1006), by Archibald
Sharp, which contains a number of
curious and instructive diagrams showing
the direction of the stress on a tire at the
point where the road slightly flattens it.
<span class='sc'>Rubber</span> (Vol. 23, p. 795), by W. R.
Dunstan, president of the International
Association of Tropical Agriculture, is
well worth reading for its information as
to the effect upon tires of exposure to air
and light, apart from wear. The materials
used, and the mechanical principles
involved, in the construction of cars are
discussed in a number of separate articles
under obvious titles.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PHOTOGRAPHY</h4>

<p class='c017'>A large place, in any review of recreations,
must be given to photography,
which, even in its most elementary form,
provides a record and an echo of an infinite
variety of amusements, and, after
a little study, not only does this all the
better, but becomes a delightful art in
itself, to be enjoyed in-doors as well as
out-doors, at all hours and at all seasons.
The amateur can find no more authoritative,
full and yet concise manual of the
subject than the Britannica article <span class='sc'>Photography</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 485), equivalent to
about 125 pages of this Guide. The first
section on History and Technique is by
Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney, author
of <i>Instruction in Photography</i>, <i>Colour
Vision</i>, etc. Next is a section on photographic
apparatus by Major-Gen. James
Waterhouse, whose photographic work
in India is known throughout the world.
And then comes a discussion of pictorial
photography by A. Horsley Hinton, author
of <i>Practical Pictorial Photography</i>.
The following is an outline of the article:</p>

<p class='c020'>History.—Eighteenth century experiments
of Scheele, Senebier and

</table>

<p class='c007'>The second part of the article deals
with the technique of photography. The
major topics in it are:</p>

<p class='c020'>Gelatin emulsions: formulae and directions
for emulsion with and without
ammonia. Coating the plates. Exposure.
Development, with formula for
alkaline developer. Intensifying and
varnishing the negative.</p>

<p class='c020'>Printing processes. Albumen method

Woodbury type. Photolithography:
the work of E. J. Asser, J. W. Osborne
and Sir H. James.</p>

<p class='c007'>Photographs in natural colours are
next described, and their history is
traced from 1810 when Seebeck of Jena
made experiments described in Goethe’s
famous work on <i>Colours</i>. <i>The first successful
colour photography was by Becquerel
in 1848</i> on a daguerreotype plate,
chlorinized. The later methods of Lippmann
and Lumière, respectively, with
collodion dry plates prepared with albumen
and with dyed gelatin plates (orthochromatic),
produce pictures in which
the colours show only from an angle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The section on the <i>Action of Light on
Chemical Compounds</i>, with a plate showing
spectra and graduation scales, contains
valuable diagrams and a chronological
table of observers of the action of
light on different substances. The paragraphs
of particular interest to the practical
photographer are those on:</p>

<p class='c020'>Measurement of the Rapidity of a
Plate.</p>

<p class='c020'>Effect of Temperature on Sensitiveness.</p>

<p class='c020'>Effect of Small Intensities of Light

<p class='c020'>Reproduction of Coloured Objects
by 3 Photographic Positives: Ives’
process; Joly’s process; Autochrome
of Lumière; Positives in 3 Colours.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another division (equivalent to 60
pages at least in this Guide) of the article
is on Apparatus. It deals especially
with the hand camera as developed from
1855 to 1888 when the Eastman Kodak
came out. And it has separate paragraphs
on Focusing; Plate-holders or
Dark-slides (1 illustration); Studio cameras;
Portable and Field cameras; Hand
cameras (7 illustrations); Twin-lens and
Reflex cameras (2 illustrations); Panoramic
cameras (2 illustrations); 3 Colour
cameras (1 illustration); Enlarging cameras
and cinematographs.</p>

<p class='c007'>A separate section deals with objectives,
and contains 45 illustrations, giving
special attention to: single achromatic
(landscape) lens, including aplanatic; unsymmetrical
doublets; symmetrical doublets;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>triple combinations; anastigmatic
combinations; telephotographic objectives;
anachromatic lenses; diaphragm
apertures.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then follows a discussion of instantaneous
shutters (with 9 illustrations) and
a discussion under “lateral” and “central”
of flap, drop, drop and flap, rotary,
roller blind, focal plane, moving blade,
central and iris shutters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Exposure meters (4 illustrations) with a
discussion of the actinic power of light;
sensitive plates, films and papers: sensitive
dry plates, plates for colour photography,
celluloid films, photographic
printing papers, apparatus for development
(with 4 illustrations); photographic
printing apparatus; bibliography.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last division of this great article is
on <i>Pictorial Photography</i>, and this is illustrated
by three full-page plates. It
deals not merely with portrait photography
but with “artistic” landscape
work, and combination printing, which
“is really what many of us practiced in
the nursery, that is, cutting out figures
and pasting them into white spaces left
for that purpose in the picture book.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to this comprehensive
treatise, in itself a complete manual of
photography, there are other articles
which will be useful to the advanced
amateur who desires either to study the
scientific aspects of the subject or to
undertake the reproduction of his work
by processes other than the ordinary
printing. The production of chemical
changes by the action of light are discussed
in <span class='sc'>Photochemistry</span> (Vol. 21, p.
484). <span class='sc'>Lens</span> (Vol. 16, p. 421) is by Dr.
Otto Henker, of the staff of the Zeiss
factory at Jena, Germany. <span class='sc'>Aberration</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 54) is by Dr. Eppenstein, another
expert of the same establishment.
The making of blocks from your own
negatives is covered by the article <span class='sc'>Process</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 408), by Edwin Bale, art
director of Cassell &#38; Co., and contains
coloured plates showing the stages of
superimposed printing. <span class='sc'>Sun Copying</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 93), by F. Vincent Brooks, a
practical printer, describes direct-contact
printing without the use of a
camera.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>OUT-DOOR GAMES</h4>

<p class='c017'>The authority which is back of the
articles in the Britannica and the fact
that its articles are on a larger scale than
those of other works of reference make
its articles on sports and games singularly
valuable. The reader who is interested in
<span class='sc'>Football</span>, for instance, will find an article
(Vol. 10, p. 617), of more than 12,000
words, part of it written by Walter Camp,
the famous American expert. It includes
a historical sketch; a description of the
Rugby Union game by Charles James
Nicol Fleming, inspector in the Scotch
Education Department, and Charles John
Bruce Marriott, secretary of the Rugby
Football Union; of the Association game,
by Charles William Alcock, late secretary
of the Football Association, London, and
Frederick Joseph Wall, secretary of the
Football Association; and of the game in
the United States, by Walter Camp and
Edward Breck. The article <span class='sc'>Golf</span> is by
H. G. Hutchinson, amateur golf champion
in 1886–87, and author of <i>Golf</i>, <i>Book
of Golf and Golfers</i>, etc. In the same way

<div class='sidenote'>Athletics</div>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between games and
athletic sports is an arbitrary one, and the
articles on athletics have been included
in the list of those
on out-door games;
but a few of them
seem to call for special mention. The article
<span class='sc'>Athletic Sports</span> (Vol. 2, p. 846)
gives a general account of amateur associations
and of national and international
meetings; and contains a special section
on the revived Olympic Games. <span class='sc'>Athlete</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 846) and <span class='sc'>Games, Classical</span>
(Vol. 11, p. 443) deal with the ancient
Greek and Roman contests. <span class='sc'>All-Round
Athletics</span> (Vol. 1, p. 709) describes the
championship, instituted in this country,
for the highest awards attained by one
athlete in eleven different branches of
sport. <span class='sc'>Amateur</span> (Vol. 1, p. 782) is a
very full and impartial discussion of the
interminable controversies regarding the
distinction between professionals and
amateurs. Among the articles on special
sports are <span class='sc'>Running</span> (Vol. 23, p. 853),
dealing with every form of race from the
100–yard dash to the Marathon run;
<span class='sc'>Hurdle-Racing</span> (Vol. 13, p. 958); <span class='sc'>Jumping</span>
(Vol. 15, p. 533); <span class='sc'>Pole Vaulting</span>
(Vol. 21, p. 977); <span class='sc'>Weight-Throwing</span>
(Vol. 28, p. 494); <span class='sc'>Putting the Shot</span> (Vol.
22, p. 672); <span class='sc'>Hammer Throwing</span> (Vol. 12,
p. 899); <span class='sc'>Caber-Tossing</span> (Vol. 4, p. 917);
<span class='sc'>Discus</span> (Vol. 8, p. 312); and <span class='sc'>Tug-of-War</span>
(Vol. 27, p. 365).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hunting</div>

<p class='c007'>The reader interested in hunting will
turn first to the articles on sporting
weapons. <span class='sc'>Gun</span> (Vol. 12, p. 717), by Sir
Henry Seton Karr,
one of the world’s
most famous big
game shots, describes the modern shot
gun in great detail, with full particulars
as to barrels, locks and ejectors. <span class='sc'>Rifle</span>
(Vol. 23, p. 325) of course includes full
descriptions of the military rifles of all
armies, and the sections on sporting
rifles and target rifles (p. 334) are by the
contributor of the article on shot guns
just mentioned. <span class='sc'>Pistol</span> (Vol. 21, p. 654)
gives a full account of the modern automatic
pistol, with diagrams showing the
mechanism of the Mauser and Colt types.
A useful table shows the length-over-all,
barrel-length, weight and composition of
cartridges, of the eleven standard types
of Colt and Smith &#38; Wesson revolvers.
<span class='sc'>Ammunition</span> (Vol. 1, p. 864) deals with
the cartridges used for guns, rifles and
pistols. The “propellants” employed are
discussed in <span class='sc'>Gunpowder</span> (Vol. 12, p.
723), by Prof. Hodgkinson; <span class='sc'>Explosives</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 81); and <span class='sc'>Cordite</span> (Vol. 7, p.
139). <span class='sc'>Shooting</span> (Vol. 24, p. 995), by
Percy Stephens, deals with the pursuit of
birds, ground game and big game in all
parts of the world. Among the varieties
of American big game mentioned are the
huge grizzlies of Alaska, the wapiti,
moose, caribou, antelope, big horn and
puma or mountain lion. The section on
the hunter’s personal equipment contains
excellent practical hints as to outfit.
Among other articles of interest in
this connection are <span class='sc'>Bird</span> (Vol. 3, p. 959),
by Prof. Hans Gadow; <span class='sc'>Rabbit</span> (Vol. 22,
p. 767), by Sir William Flower and Richard
Lyddeker; <span class='sc'>Deer</span> (Vol. 7, p. 923);
<span class='sc'>Antelope</span> (Vol. 2, p. 89); <span class='sc'>Elk</span> (Vol. 9,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>p. 290); <span class='sc'>Bear</span> (Vol. 3, p. 573); <span class='sc'>Puma</span>
(Vol. 22, p. 644); and <span class='sc'>Carnivora</span> (Vol. 5,
p. 366). There is a separate article on
<span class='sc'>Pigeon Shooting</span> (Vol. 21, p. 597). On
each species of African and Asiatic big
game there is an elaborate article. The
dogs used in sports of all kinds are described
in the article <span class='sc'>Dog</span> (Vol. 8, p. 374),
by Walter Baxendale, kennel editor of
the London <i>Field</i>, and Prof. Chalmers
Mitchell, with five full-page plates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Riding to hounds, including fox-hunting,
stag-hunting, hare-hunting and the
drag hunt, is covered by the article <span class='sc'>Hunting</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 946), by A. E. T. Watson,
editor of the <i>Badminton Library</i>. Other
forms of the chase are dealt with in
<span class='sc'>Coursing</span> (Vol. 7, p. 321) and <span class='sc'>Falconry</span>
(Vol. 19, p. 141), by Lieut.-Col. Delmé
Radcliffe.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fishing</div>

<p class='c007'>The key article on line fishing is <span class='sc'>Angling</span>
(Vol. 2, p. 21), in length equivalent
to 35 pages of this Guide. It begins with
a most interesting
historical section,
showing that, before
the days of the earliest hooks, the cave-men
used on their lines a little flake of
flint or strip of stone, fixed in the bait,
with a groove in the middle of it, around
which the line was so fastened that when
the pull came the instrument turned
crossways in the fish’s stomach and could
not be disgorged. A delightful section on
angling literature follows this historical
matter; and then comes treatment of
fresh water fishing, with fly-casting and
the use of surface baits; live-baiting and
spinning; and bottom-fishing; each of the
three fully treated. A detailed study is
then made of the habits of the salmon
and of the tackle and methods devised
for his beguiling. Trout, muskelunge,
bass, perch and roach are successively
discussed; and then comes the section on
sea-angling, the tarpon, tuna, jewfish
and the giant black bass. The article
ends with a complete bibliography of
the subject. There are 96 articles on individual
fish, all listed on p. 891 of Vol.
29, if the reader desires to refresh his
memory as to the varieties. <span class='sc'>Fisheries</span>
(Vol. 10, p. 429), by Prof. Garstang and
Prof. Chalmers Mitchell is concerned
with the industry rather than with sport,
but it contains much information about
sea fish which will be of use to the sea-angler.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Taxidermy</div>

<p class='c007'>A thoroughly practical article is <span class='sc'>Taxidermy</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 464), by Montague
Browne, author of a manual of the art.
His book and Dr.
W. T. Hornaday’s
<i>Taxidermy and Zoological
Collecting</i> are the most important
special books on the subject, and
Mr. Browne in this article constantly
refers to the improved methods introduced
by Hornaday and other Americans.
He points out the dangers of using
arsenical soap and gives the formula for
the substitute, quite safe except when
hot, which he himself invented. Minute
directions are given for skinning, mounting,
etc. And the article also treats of
the advantages of modelling as compared
with the old method of “stuffing”;
and the placing of specimens in
natural surroundings, with panoramic
back-grounds, top- and side-lighting, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sailing and Boating</div>

<p class='c007'>On sailing, boating and kindred subjects
the reader should first consult the
article <span class='sc'>Yachting</span> (Vol. 28, p. 890),
equivalent to 26
pages of this Guide,
by B. Heckstall-Smith,
yachting editor
the <i>Field</i>, and secretary of the Yacht
Racing Association and of the International
Yacht Racing Union. The historical
part of this article traces yachting
in England back to the state-barges of
the Anglo-Saxon kings and through the
pleasure ship of Elizabeth (1588), which
was built at Cowes in the Isle of Wight,
so that this place has been associated
with the sport for more than three centuries.
Charles II in 1660 received the
present of a yacht from the Dutch, and
at this time the Dutch word “yacht” first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>found its way into the English language.
Yachting clubs date from the establishment
in 1720 of the Cork Harbour Water
Club, now the Royal Cork Yacht Club.
At Cowes races were sailed as early as
1780 and a yacht club was organized
there in 1812. The first yacht club in
the United States was formed in 1844
and the first race in the United States
was at New York in 1846 to Sandy Hook
light-ship and back. The first important
alteration in type was in 1848 when the
“Mosquito” was built—a 50–ton vessel,
59 ft. 2 in. at water line, 15 ft. 3 in. beam,
with a long hollow bow and a short and
rather full after-body. The first races in
the United States resulted in the building
of the “America,” which in 1851 crossed
the ocean and won a race round the Isle
of Wight, bringing back to the New York
Yacht Club the “America’s” cup. The
later races for this cup are described in
detail at the close of the article, with
elaborate tables showing the exact tonnage
or sailing length of competing
yachts, dates of races, time allowance,
elapsed time, corrected time, and margin
by which each race was won. The article
describes 1870–1880 as the first great era
of yachting. Changes in the method of
reckoning length, introduced in 1879, resulted
in the “lead mine” or plank-on-edge
type. In 1887 the system of tonnage
measurement was introduced and a
method of rating by water-line length
and sail area—and this “crushed the
plank-on-edge type completely. There
was not another boat of the kind built.”
The era of big cutters followed—in America
notably the Herreshoff boats. The
success of the bulb keels in the small
classes threatened the use of “skimming
dishes” in the larger classes—and a consequent
lack of head room and cabin
accommodation. New linear rating rules
were therefore adopted—one in 1896 and
another in 1901, followed in 1904 by international
rating rules. The English
types of Fife and Nicholson were succeeded
by such boats from the Krupp
yard at Kiel as the “Meteor” and “Germania.”

Yachting</span> (Vol. 18, p. 640).</p>

<p class='c007'>Other articles on the subject of boating
are <span class='sc'>Canoe</span> (Vol. 5, p. 189); <span class='sc'>MacGregor,
John</span> (Vol. 17, p. 232) (for the famous
“Rob Roy”); <span class='sc'>Catamaran</span> (Vol. 5, p.
502); and <span class='sc'>Rowing</span> (Vol. 23, p. 783), by
Charles Murray Pitman, formerly stroke
of the Oxford University eight, with a
special treatment of rowing in the United
States and a comparison of English and
American “styles.” The articles <span class='sc'>Swimming</span>
(Vol. 26, p. 231) by William Henry,
author of <i>Swimming</i> in the Badminton
Library, and <span class='sc'>Drowning and Life
Saving</span> (Vol. 8, p. 592) are of practical
value.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mountaineering</div>

<p class='c007'>The article <span class='sc'>Mountaineering</span> (Vol.
18, p. 937) is by Sir W. Martin Conway,
famous for his ascent to a height of
23,000 feet in the
Kara Koram Himalayas,
for the High
Level route through the Alps which he
originated, and for his climbs in Spitsbergen.
It contains paragraphs on the
dangers from falling rocks, falling ice,
snow avalanches, falls from rocks, ice
slopes, crevasses, and weather; and an
outline of history of the sport, which has
been systematically pursued only since
1854. <span class='sc'>Glacier</span> (Vol. 12, p. 60), by E.
C. Spicer is another article of great interest
to those who love climbing.
Among the articles on individual mountains
and on the great ranges, the first
place must be given to the scene of the
classic exploits of the early mountaineers.
The relevant part of the article <span class='sc'>Alps</span>
(Vol. 1, p. 737) is by W. A. B. Coolidge
who, although an American by birth, is
more at home in the Alps than any other
living writer. This magnificent article,
which would fill nearly 40 pages of this
Guide, contains a table giving the heights
of no less than 1,317 separate peaks and
passes, and also a consecutive narrative
of Alpine exploration. <span class='sc'>Himalaya</span> (Vol.
13, p. 470) is by Sir Thomas H. Holdich,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>superintendent of Frontier Surveys in
India. The best mountaineering section
of the Rockies is described in a section of
the article <span class='sc'>Canada</span> (Vol. 4, p. 145).
<span class='sc'>Andes</span> (Vol. 1, p. 960) describes the peaks
of the Southern Cordillera. Full articles
on the mountaineering sections of our
own country, such as the Appalachians,
the Adirondacks, the Catskills and White
Mountains will be found under the
obvious titles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Winter Sports</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Skating</span> (Vol. 25, p. 166) deals with
both speed skating and figure skating,
and tells of the exploits at Newburgh,
N. Y., of Charles
June and of the famous
Donoghue
family. A table of amateur records is
also given. Ice hockey is treated in a
section of the article <span class='sc'>Hockey</span> (Vol. 13, p.
554). <span class='sc'>Curling</span> (Vol. 7, p. 645) describes
the “rink” and stones, as well as the
game, and contains a glossary of technical
terms. <span class='sc'>Ice Yachting</span> (Vol. 14, p.
241) explains the mechanical paradox
which makes it possible for a boat propelled
by the wind to move faster than
the wind is blowing. Ski-running and
jumping, with the new development of
military skiing in France and Italy, are
described in <span class='sc'>Ski</span> (Vol. 25, p. 186); and it
will surprise many readers to learn that
a clear jump of more than 130 feet has
been made. Other articles dealing with
winter sports are <span class='sc'>Snowshoes</span> (Vol. 22,
p. 296), <span class='sc'>Coasting</span> (Vol. 6, p. 603) and
<span class='sc'>Tobogganing</span> (Vol. 26, p. 1042).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Driving, Riding and Polo</div>

<p class='c007'>For information in regard to sports
connected with the horse the reader
should first study the article <span class='sc'>Horse</span> and
particularly that part
which concerns the
history of horse
breeding (pp 717–723
of Vol. 13), written by E. D. Brickwood,
an English authority on sport, and
the sections on “breeds of horses” by the
late William Fream, agricultural correspondent
of the London <i>Times</i>, and Prof.
Robert Wallace, of Edinburgh University,
who also wrote the section on management.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Horse-Racing</span> (Vol. 13, p. 726) contains
a section on racing in the United
States, including the development of
trotting races and the stress put upon
time records, pacing races, racing centres,
the predominance of dirt-tracks as
contrasted with the turf courses of England;
a section on the history of English
racing, including the institution of the
St. Leger, the Derby, the Oaks, the Ascot
races, the Goodwood, Two Thousand
Guineas, etc., present conditions, including
classic races, handicaps, with scale
of weight for age, the £10,000 races, the
two-year-old races, Newmarket, Ascot
and other meetings, value of horses,
trainers and jockeys, foreign horses, time,
the Jockey Club and steeple-chasing, the
Grand National; a section on racing in
Australia; a section on racing in France,
where, as in England, American owners
and jockeys have for some years past
been much to the front; and also a mention
of the chief meetings in other European
countries and in Australia. <span class='sc'>Horsemanship</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 726) is chiefly concerned
with exhibition riding. <span class='sc'>Driving</span>
(Vol. 8, p. 585), by R. J. McNeill, discusses
the intricacies of tandem and four-in-hand
coachmanship, and contains a
section on the use of the whip. The importance
of acquiring a light hand, and
the extent to which this depends on the
proper use of the three joints in the arm,
are clearly explained. <span class='sc'>Coach</span> (Vol. 6, p.
574) tells about the amateur road coach
and the four-in-hand clubs in America
and elsewhere. The coaching horn or
“post-horn,” as it used to be called, is
treated under <span class='sc'>Horn</span> (Vol. 13, p. 697) by
Kathleen Schlesinger, the great authority
on musical instruments. <span class='sc'>Carriage</span> (Vol.
5, p. 401), by J. A. McNaught, notes
that, although the buggy and rockaway
are the characteristic pleasure vehicles of
this country, the heavier dog-cart and
ralli-cart are much used with horses of a
certain type.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>The article <span class='sc'>Polo</span> (Vol. 22, p. 11), by
Thomas F. Dale, steward of the Polo
and Riding Pony Society, describes the
twelve varieties of the game played during
its existence of at least 2,000 years.
The three modern forms are the Indian,
the English and the American, the game
in England dating from 1869 when it was
introduced from India by the 10th Hussars—and
more definitely from 1873
when it was adopted by the Hurlingham
Club. The rules of the game are given,
and its development is traced, and there
is a section on the polo pony and the
much discussed systems of measurement.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gardening</div>

<p class='c007'>Out-door recreation in the garden may
be fully studied in the article <span class='sc'>Horticulture</span>
(Vol. 13, p. 741), which is a

its contents are the
equivalent of about
140 pages of this Guide. It is written by
Liberty Hyde Bailey, director of the
College of Agriculture, Cornell University,
who contributes a valuable gardeners’
calendar for the United States, M. T.
Masters, editor of <i>Gardeners’ Chronicle</i>,

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>INDOOR GAMES</h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>For learning indoor games—excluding
indoor athletic games which have been
listed above—the Britannica is particularly
valuable, because of its elaborate
treatment by noted authorities and because
the handy and convenient form
of the India paper volume makes an
article on any indoor game as easy to
consult as a hand-book dealing with
only one game.</p>

<p class='c007'>For example, the article on <span class='sc'>Bridge</span>
(Vol. 4, p. 528) is by William Henry
Whitfeld, card-editor of <i>The Field</i>. The
article is the equivalent of 15 pages in
this Guide; and it describes both auction
and ordinary bridge, with paragraphs on
advice to players, declarations, doubling,
redoubling, play of the hand, playing
to the score; and other forms of bridge,—three-handed
bridge, dummy bridge,
misery bridge, and draw or two-handed
bridge; and contains a list of authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even more elaborate, as befits the
subject, is the article <span class='sc'>Chess</span> (Vol. 6, p.
93), equivalent to 45 pages of this Guide.
It contains diagrams showing the arrangement
of pieces and the English and German
methods of notation and a vocabulary
of terms of the game; it treats the
comparative value of the pieces—“pawn
1, bishop 3.25, knight 3.25, rook 5,
queen 9.5. Three minor pieces may more
often than not be advantageously exchanged
for the queen. The knight is
generally stronger than the bishop in
the end of the game, but two bishops
are usually stronger than two knights,
more especially in open positions.” English,
French and German modes of notation
and names of pieces are given.
The treatment of chess problems is
accompanied by eight typical problems
with diagrams and analyses. The section
on the history of chess gives not
merely very interesting early material
but a study critical and biographical,
of the great chess masters—for example:
Ruy Lopez, the first chess analyst
Greco; Philidor, a great blindfold and
simultaneous player of the 18th century;
Allgaier; Mahé de la Bourdonnais; the
English school of the 19th century,
Sarratt, Lewis, Mac Donnell, Evans
(of the gambit), Staunton (on whom
there is a separate article) and Buckle,
the historian of civilization; the Berlin
“Pleiades” and the Hungarians, Grimm,
Szen and Löwenthal; Morphy, the American;
and among the great players of the
last half century, Steinitz, Paulsen,
Blackburne, Zukertort, Horwitz, Mason,
Teichman, Pillsbury, Lasker, Mieses,
Marshall, Tarrasch, Tchigorin, etc. The
results of international tournaments are
given from 1851 on; and modern tournament
play is criticised. The article
closes with an elaborate bibliography.</p>

<p class='c007'>The article on <span class='sc'>Draughts</span> or Checkers
(Vol. 8, p. 547) is by J. M. M. Dallas,
late secretary of the Edinburgh Draughts
Club, and Richard Jordan, former
draughts champion of the world, and
gives the history of the game, with a
study of the different openings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The usefulness of the Britannica for
card games in general may be easily
tested. Let us turn for instance to the
article <span class='sc'>Poker</span> (Vol. 21, p. 899). It is

<div class='sidenote'>Needlework, etc.</div>

<p class='c007'>Needlework as treated in the Britannica
has one element of peculiar value
and novelty. In this
department, as
throughout the book,
the illustrations have been chosen upon a
principle unusual in works of reference:
they really illustrate; they throw light
on the text; they are not mere pretty
pictures intended to catch the eye and
inserted in the book haphazard. Turn
for instance to the article <span class='sc'>Lace</span> (Vol. 16,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>p. 37). Among its 61 illustrations are
not only small diagrams explaining
different stitches and meshes and patterns
and larger halftone illustrations of
“Bone Lace” “Reticella Needlepoint”,
“Gros Point de Venise”, “Point de
Flandres à Brides” “Point de Venise à
Brides Picotées,” “Réseau Rosacé,” etc.,
but there are reproductions of portraits
of the 16th, 17th and early 18th centuries,
showing not merely patterns of lace but
the method in which it was used and
how it “combined” and harmonized with
styles of costume, and of hair dressing.
These “lace portraits” are: one from the
Louvre, about 1540 of Catherine de’
Medici, wearing a linen upturned collar
of cut work and needlepoint lace; one
by Morcelse, about 1600, of Amelie Elisabeth,
comtesse de Hainault, wearing a
ruff of needlepoint reticella lace; one,
1614, of Mary, countess of Pembroke,
wearing a coif and cuffs of reticella lace;
one by Le Nain, about 1628, of Henri
II, duc de Montmorency, wearing a
falling lace collar; one by Riley, about
1685, of James II, wearing a jabot and
cuffs of raised needlepoint lace; one,
about 1664, of Mme. Verbiest, wearing
pillow-made lace <i>à reseau</i>; one, about
1695, of Princess Maria Teresa Stuart,
wearing a flounce or tablier of delicate
needlepoint lace with small relief clusters;
and one of de Vintimille, about 1730,
wearing needlepoint of the <i>Point de Venise
à brides picotées</i>. This article on
Lace, equivalent in length to 60 pages
of this Guide, is by A. Summerly Cole,
author of <i>Ancient Needle Point and
Pillow Lace</i>. <span class='sc'>Embroidery</span> (Vol. 9, p.
309) is by Mr. Cole and A. F. Kendrick,
keeper of the Victoria and Albert Museum,
South Kensington; and is illustrated
with 18 figures showing many styles of
early embroidery. There are also articles
on Tapestry, Needlework, Knitting,
Yarn, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dancing, the Stage, etc.</div>

<p class='c007'>On dancing and the stage there is
much of interest in the Britannica. The
article on the <span class='sc'>Dance</span> (Vol. 7, p. 794)
distinguishes dancing as an expression
of emotion, whether
social joy or religious
exultation; dancing
for pleasure to the
dancer or the spectator; and mimetic
dancing, “to represent the actions or
passions of other people.” A section
on primitive and ancient dancing describes
various early dances, many of
them not unlike the “trots” and “hugs”
so notorious during the last few years.
At an Aztec feast, “called Huitzilopochtli,
the noblemen and women danced
tied together at the hands, and embracing
one another, the arms being thrown over
the neck.” Primitive imitative dances,
the attitude of the ancient Romans
towards the dance, religious dances and
the attacks on the dance of such Puritan
sects as the Albigenses and Waldenses
close the section on ancient
dancing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Modern dancing” describes the branle
(or brawl), the pavane, saraband, minuet,
gavotte, écossaise, cotillon, galop, lancers,
schottische, bourrée, waltz, fandango,
bolero, jota, Morris dances, hornpipe,
and other English dances of the 17th
and 18th centuries. In treating of
present-day dancing the article deals
especially with the waltz, quadrille,
country-dance, lancers, polka, galop,
Washington Post and other American
barn-dances, polka-mazurka, Polonaise,
Schottische and Sir Roger de Coverley.
And it discusses ballet dancing (on which
there is also a separate article) and
musical gymnastics. There are separate
articles on the following dances: <span class='sc'>Allemande</span>,
<span class='sc'>Bergamask</span>, <span class='sc'>Chaconne</span>, <span class='sc'>Chasse</span>,
<span class='sc'>Courante</span>, <span class='sc'>Gavotte</span>, <span class='sc'>Jig</span>, <span class='sc'>Mazurka</span>,
<span class='sc'>Morris Dance</span>, <span class='sc'>Passacaglia</span>, <span class='sc'>Pavane</span>,
<span class='sc'>Polka</span>, <span class='sc'>Polonaise</span>, <span class='sc'>Quadrille</span>, <span class='sc'>Saraband</span>,
<span class='sc'>Schottische</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a sufficient knowledge of the
theatre and the drama to heighten his
enjoyment of a play, the theatre-goer
should read up the subject, the period
and the author in the Britannica. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>a more serious and thorough study of
opera, music in general and the drama
as a literary form, he may turn to special
chapters of this Guide.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TRAVEL AT HOME AND ABROAD</h4>

<p class='c017'>If the traveler would make the most
of his vacation journeys—as has already
been suggested—he should “read up”
in the Britannica, even if he does not
wish to make a systematic study of the
literature, art, architecture, music, etc.,
of the country he is to visit. If he does
wish to pursue systematic study he can
use the Britannica to better advantage
than a whole library of books of travel
or special treatises.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Britannica has often and successfully
been used in this way. A single
instance: The Rev. Dr. George R. Van
DeWater of St. Andrews Church, New
York City, in a letter addressed to the
publishers of the new Britannica, wrote:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have recently had occasion to look
up South America with a view to obtaining
needed information for a proposed
tour there, and I found all that I wanted
to know and found it readily.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the general classes of valuable
information for the traveler are:</p>

<p class='c007'>The excellent maps, newly made with
the greatest care from the best sources;</p>

<p class='c007'>Articles on the great countries of the
world. Particularly valuable sections
are those at the beginning of each of
these articles on physiography, climate,
etc., and those on transportation by
rail and water;</p>

<p class='c007'>Articles on the states of the Union,
similarly arranged, and like them accompanied
by maps and with full descriptions
of the surface of the country
and the means of communication, climate,
etc.;</p>

<p class='c007'>Articles on regions, rivers, mountains,
etc.,—for instance on the <span class='sc'>Riviera</span>, <span class='sc'>Alps</span>,
<span class='sc'>Nile</span>, <span class='sc'>Rhine</span>, <span class='sc'>Hudson</span>, <span class='sc'>Yosemite</span>, <span class='sc'>Yellowstone</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Articles on cities and towns, with descriptions
of the principal places of interest,
historical sketches, diagrams of
battle-fields, etc.;</p>

<p class='c007'>General articles such as <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>,
<span class='sc'>Painting</span>, <span class='sc'>Museums</span>, which give critical
and related accounts of great art treasures
of different periods and schools.
To this information, as bearing on the
particular place the traveler intends to
visit, he will be guided by the Index;</p>

<p class='c007'>Biographical articles related to the
special vicinity to be visited—as for instance,
<span class='sc'>Wordsworth</span>, <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span> and
<span class='sc'>DeQuincey</span> for the Lake District.</p>

<p class='c007'>This survey, already too long for the
limited space of this Guide, yet far too
brief to represent properly the aspect
of the Britannica with which it deals,
will have accomplished its purpose if
it induces the possessor of the volumes
to go to them when he needs relaxation.
Articles of the kind described in this chapter,
showing you how to make the most
of leisure hours, are doubly serviceable,
giving pleasure while they are being
read, and again when their suggestions
are carried into effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is not only in the articles dealing
with recreation that Britannica reading
insures future as well as present
enjoyment. Lafcadio Hearn said it was
worth while to visit Japan if only because
what one sees there makes one’s dreams
more beautiful all through later life. And
so the fascination of history, of science,
of biography, does not end, but only
begins, with the reading which opens
for you a gate leading into fresh fields.
What you read this coming year, in any
department of the Britannica, will be
still, ten years from now, a source of
pleasure, for knowledge, once acquired,
brings continually renewed delight.</p>
